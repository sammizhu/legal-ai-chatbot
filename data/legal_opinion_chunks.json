Roe and others.", "court": "Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Missouri", "date": "April 9, 1880.", "text": "Date: April 9, 1880.\nJudge: MCCRARY, J.\n\nJohn B. Henderson and Patrick & Frank, for complainant.\n\n\n\nGlover & Shepley, for respondents.\n\n\nMCCRARY, J. The claim sued on originated in the execution of two promissory notes by John J. Roe, one dated February 28, 1867, for $65,000, and the other dated March 4, 1867, for $35,000, payable on call and to himself. The fraud and breach of trust charged against said John J. Roe as a director of the National Bank of the State of Missouri, is alleged as having been committed on the fourteenth day of April, 1868, and consisted, as the bill avers, in certain entries upon the books of said bank made by said Roe, who was one of the directors, in collusion with the other directors of the bank. It is averred that said notes, and other similar notes given by other directors, had been discounted by the bank and were held by it as part of the assets, and that on the date last named entries were fraudulently made upon [*693] the books of the bank showing payment thereof, though no part of said notes, or either of them, except interest up to that time, had been paid, and no payment thereon has been since made. This of course makes, if true, a clear case of indebtedness from said Roe to the bank. The indebtedness, according to these allegations, accrued as early as the fourteenth day of April, 1868. John J. Roe died on the fourteenth day of February, 1870. His estate was administered upon under the laws of Missouri, and this claim was not proven before the probate court. Said estate has been fully administered by the administrator, and the administration closed. Certain real and personal property left by the deceased having passed to the defendants herein, as his heirs, this suit is intended to subject the same to the payment of the plaintiff's demand, the bill for this purpose having been filed on the seventeenth day of June, 1879.\n\nIt will thus be seen that the cause of action accrued nearly two years before the death of John J. Roe, and more than 10 years prior to the bringing of this suit, and is therefore barred by the statute of limitations of Missouri, (if that statute is to be followed here,) unless the plaintiff has taken the case out of the statute by the allegations of his bill concerning the concealment of the alleged fraud and its discovery. Upon this point the bill alleges, in substance, that the fraud complained of was concealed by the directors of the bank, (said John J. Roe, up the time of his death, being one of them,) in collusion with the cashier, whereby the said national bank, and its stockholders and creditors, were kept in ignorance of the facts until July 10, 1877, when the fraud was discovered by the complainant. It is further alleged that the claim here sued upon arises out of the breach of an express trust by the said John J. Roe and his associates, and for that reason said statute of limitations does not affect the complainant's right of recovery herein, and it is alleged generally \"that, in consequence of said fraud, and the concealment thereof as aforesaid, the claim here sued upon is, in equity, excepted from the operation of the statute of limitations, in [*694] order to prevent such statute from operating as a fraud upon said bank, and your orator, as receiver thereof.\"\n\nI am of the opinion that there is a sufficient averment in the bill of a fraudulent concealment of the cause of action, and the question, therefore, is whether, notwithstanding such concealment, the defendants can successfully plead the statute of limitations.\n\nThe statute of Missouri concerning administration requires the presentation of all claims against an estate within two years from the time of the publication of a notice of the administration to creditors, and it declares that \"all demands not thus exhibited within two years shall be forever barred.\" There is a saving clause in favor of infants, persons of unsound mind, persons imprisoned, and married women, but nothing is said as to cases of concealed fraud. 2 Wagner's St. 86, 102.\n\nThe general statute on the subject of the limitation of actions provides that, in an action for relief on the ground of fraud, the cause of action shall be deemed not to have accrued until the discovery of the fraud by the aggrieved party. 1 Wag. 747.\n\nIt is earnestly contended, on behalf of the respondents, that, according to the construction placed by the supreme court of Missouri upon these statutes, the action is barred, notwithstanding the discovery of the fraud within two years. Upon this subject counsel insist:\n\nFirst. That the statute regulating the prosecution and collection of claims against an estate absolutely bars all demands not exhibited within two years, and that, since no exception is made by the statute itself in favor of demands growing out of concealed fraud, the court is not at liberty to engraft this exception upon the statute.\n\nSecond. That the general statute of limitations, which does contain a provision declaring that in actions on the ground of fraud the cause of action shall be deemed not to have accrued until discovery by the aggrieved party, does not apply to this case.\n\nUpon the first proposition we are referred to McKenzie v. Hall, Adm'r, 51 Mo. 303 [*695] ; Richardson v. Harrison, 36 Mo. 96 ; and, upon the second, to Rogers v. Bronson, 61 Mo. 187 .\n\nWithout determining whether these authorities sustain the propositions stated, we turn to another inquiry, which necessarily requires prior consideration. Is it true that the courts of the United States are bound to follow, as rules of decision in equity cases, the statutes of limitation of the several states, and the construction given to them by the state judiciary? It is insisted that under the twenty-fourth section of the judiciary act (Rev. St. \u00a7 721) the statutes of limitation of the several states, where no special provision has been made by congress, form the rule of decision in the courts of the United States, and that the same effect is given to them as is given in the courts of the state. Such is undoubtedly the rule in cases at common law, and the statute, by its terms, applies to no other cases. I think it well settled that a federal court of equity is not bound by such statutes, and much less by the construction given to them by the state tribunals. In the exercise of the chancery jurisdiction conferred by the constitution and laws of the United States this court is not governed by the state practice. The supreme court has repeatedly decided that the rules governing the exercise of this jurisdiction are the same in all the states, and are according to the practice of courts of equity in the parent country, as contra-distinguished from that of courts of law. The exercise of this jurisdiction is regulated by the act of 1792, (Rev. St. \u00a7 913,) which declares that the modes of proceeding shall be according to the principles, rules and usages which belong to courts of equity, as contradistinguished from courts of law. The rules of decision in equity cases in the federal courts are to be uniform, and in the exercise of their equity jurisdiction those courts are unaffected by state legislation. Boyle v. Zachary, 6 Pet. 658 ; United States v. Howland, 4 Wheat. 115 ; Neves v. Scott, 13 How. 271 ; Noonan v. Lee, 2 Black. 507; Robinson v. Campbell, 3 Wheat. 323 .\n\nThe only question, therefore, is whether this court should, upon principle, adopt and follow the statute of limitations of Missouri as construed by the supreme court of that state. [*696] If the interpretation given to the rulings of the supreme court of Missouri by the counsel for defendants is the true one, I do not hesitate to say that this court cannot follow those rulings. The statute, thus construed, would be in direct conflict with a well-settled rule of equity jurisprudence as understood and administered in the federal courts for many years. It would require this court to hold that, in a case where the demand happens to be against an estate, a party who has committed a fraud may consummate it beyond the possibility of remedy by concealing it. This seems to me to be a proposition that no court of equity can, with propriety, maintain, if left free, as this court is, to consider it upon the merits. In cases where the federal courts follow, in equity, the state statutes of limitation by analogy, they do so because equity requires it, and the statutes are found to be in harmony with its general principles.\n\nThe rule that the statute of limitations does not run in favor of one who perpetrates a fraud while he conceals it from the party injured, as a general doctrine of equity jurisprudence, is too well settled to require the citation of authorities.\n\nThe demurrer to the bill is overruled."}

The Pennsylvania Railroad Company.", "court": "Circuit Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania", "date": "January 23, 1880.", "text": "Date: January 23, 1880.\nJudge: MCKENNAN, J.\n\nJohn Fallon, for plaintiff.\n\n\n\nWayne McVeagh and Chapman Biddle, for defendant.\n\n\nMCKENNAN, J. This suit was brought to recover from the defendant the value of certain wool, delivered to it at Chicago for transportation to Philadelphia. A jury having been waived, the case was tried by the court upon the evidence submitted by the parties. The following facts are found as established by the evidence:\n\n1. The value of the goods in controversy was, on the twenty-second day of July, 1877, at the point of shipment, $18,060.38, and at the point of destination, $20,972.97.\n\n2. \"The said goods had, in course of transit from their place of shipment to their respective destinations, reached [*227] the city of Pittsburgh at least 24 hours before the fire occurred in said city, on July 21 and 22, 1877, and were then in defendant's custody in the cars in which they had been shipped, and the said cars and the said goods were burned in said fire.\"\n\n3. \"The defendant, about July 19, 1877, found itself unable to maintain, against the force of a mob, entire possession and control of its own property, and the property in its custody, including that of the plaintiff, and to operate its road. It then called upon the proper authorities, including the sheriff of Allegheny county, for assistance and protection; a requisition was made by said sheriff upon the governor for the assistance of the military power of the commonwealth. In pursuance of such requisition, troops were ordered by the governor to aid said sheriff in retaking and redelivering to the defendant entire possession and control of such property, and to enable it to operate its roads; and in endeavoring so to do said troops, on July 21, 1877, came into conflict with said mob and failed to dispossess the same, and immediately after said conflict and failure the property in question was destroyed by fire communicated by said mob.\"\n\n4. The goods in question were \"received by the defendant on bills of lading of the form of the annexed receipt, being one of what is usually known as the 'Red Star Union Line fast freight' receipts, with all and singular the conditions therein contained.\" This bill of lading is numbered No. 2,856, and is thus identified and exhibited as part of the finding in this case.\n\nThe foregoing facts are found in pursuance of the written admission of the parties filed in the case.\n\nIt is further found:\n\n5. If the transit of the goods in question had not been interrupted at Pittsburgh, and had been continued in regular course, the train containing them would have been at a considerable distance from Pittsburgh eastward before the time of the occurrence of the fire.\n\n6. When the train containing said goods reached the depot of the defendant in Pittsburgh, on July 19th, the hands who [*228] had conducted it there left it, and a \"strike\" of all the regular train hands of the defendant occurred on that day, in consequence of a refusal by the defendant to accede to their demand for an increase of wages.\n\n7. On the nineteenth of July there were standing on the track in the depot yard at Pittsburgh a number of cars laden with petroleum, about 150 yards distant from the cars which contained the plaintiff's goods. They were in the same relative position on the day when the fire occurred. The oil cars were kept in place by ordinary brakes. The grade of the road was descending towards the freight cars, so that the oil cars would run towards the former by their own gravity. At or before the occurrence of the fire the oil cars were caused to move down the grade until they came in contact with the freight cars, and they were all burned up together.\n\n8. On the nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first of July, freight trains continued to be brought into the depot yard of the defendant, at Pittsburgh, both from the east and west, in the regular course of transit, and were there stopped, so that there was an unusual accumulation of trains at that point.\n\nThe court is respectfully requested by plaintiff to find, as matters of law:\n\n1. That defendant's duty as common carriers was to carry plaintiff's goods from the several points of shipment to * * Philadelphia, the point of delivery of all, without any unusual or avoidable delay, and, apart from the special conditions in the bill of lading, defendant is liable for loss from any cause save the acts of God or a public enemy.\n\n2. That defendant did not cease to be common carriers by reason of the conditions in the bill of lading, but continued subject to all liabilities of common carriers, except for losses happening for causes enumerated in said conditions, without default or negligence on the part of defendant's servants or employes, while defendant was actually discharging its duties of carrying the goods from the point of shipment in the usual and proper mariner.\n\n3. That the interruption of the transit by reason of the refusal of the servants of the defendant, in charge of the [*229] freight trains on which plaintiff's goods were being carried, to perform their duty was a default on part of defendant.\n\n3. That the strike and refusal to perform duty on the part of the men does not justify or excuse the interruption of the transit of plaintiff's goods; and that defendant's election not to pay the 10 per cent. additional wages demanded, and in lieu thereof to allow the goods to remain at Pittsburgh, wholly or partly in the control of persons who prevented defendant from \"operating its road\" and performing its contract as common carriers, makes defendant liable for all the consequences, including the destruction and loss of said goods, during the period that the transit was thus interrupted, and the plaintiff's property thus wrongfully controlled, without proof of any other negligence or misconduct on the part of defendant.\n\n4. That allowing or suffering others than its own employes to take from defendant the possession or control, whether in whole or in part, of plaintiff's goods, and to use that control, not for the purpose of furthering or continuing the transit, but for the purpose of suspending and preventing it, was a default on part of defendant.\n\n5. That however proper it may have been for defendant to call on the public authorities for protection and assistance \"in retaking and redelivering to defendant the entire possession and control of said property,\" such act of propriety in no way justifies the previous default in suffering the possession and control thereof to pass out of its hands.\n\n6. That the various risks enumerated in said conditions, which are assumed by plaintiff in relief of defendant's general liability, and more especially the risk \"of fire while in transit,\" are limited to losses occurring while the defendant is engaged in carrying the goods, in the proper discharge of its duties under the contract, and do not include loss by fire occurring while the transit is suspended, and the goods in question have been suffered by defendant to pass into the possession and control of persons acting adversely to the duties defendant assumed to discharge.\n\n7. That it was gross default and negligence on the part of defendant to allow freight trains to come into Pittsburgh on [*230] the nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first of July, under the circumstances in the seventh clause of the facts, which the court is requested by plaintiff to find, mentioned.\n\n8. That it was gross default and negligence to allow cars loaded with petroleum to continue to stand on the track, under all the circumstances and manner, and for the period of time in the eighth clause of said facts mentioned.\n\n9. That defendant is responsible for the misconduct and default of the persons whom it suffered to take control and possession, wholly or jointly with itself, of plaintiff's property, and to continue in such control for the space of two or three days, during the period of time while that control and possession continued, and for all loss resulting from such misconduct.\n\n10. On the facts and law aforesaid, plaintiff prays the court to enter judgment for $20,973.97, and interest from July 22, 1877, to the day judgment is rendered.\n\nAnswers by the court to the foregoing propositions of law presented by the plaintiff's counsel:\n\n1. This proposition is affirmed.\n\n2. This is also affirmed.\n\n3. As it was the duty of the defendant, as a common carrier, to transport the goods of the plaintiff to their point of destination without unreasonable delay, any injurious interruption of such transportation, by the refusal of the defendant's servants to perform their duty, would be a breach of duty imputable to it; and for any loss to the plaintiff, caused by such delay, the defendant would be liable in damages.\n\n3. I decline to affirm this proposition. The evidence does not show that the loss complained of was caused by the \"strike,\" nor that any permissive allowance of the retention of the goods at Pittsburgh can be imputed to the defendant. On the contrary, it is admitted by the plaintiff that the defendant was coerced by the superior power of a lawless mob, which usurped control of the train containing the plaintiff's goods, and prevented the defendant from operating its road; that the defendant took prompt steps to meet the emergency by an appeal to the civil authorities for protection and assistance; [*231] that these authorities, with the military force summoned by them, were repelled; and that the train, with these goods, was thereupon destroyed by an incendiary fire.\n\nWhile these circumstances would not protect the defendant against a failure to fulfil its obligations as a common carrier, yet I cannot say that an involuntary technical default warrants an imputation of negligence to the defendant touching a cause of loss which is expressly excepted from its liability.\n\n4. The defendant was deprived of the control of the train containing the plaintiff's goods, and was prevented from continuing their transit, by a force it was unable to resist. It cannot be held responsible for the purpose of the mob, although the act of the mob in intercepting the transportation of the goods might subject the defendant to compensation to the plaintiff for any loss sustained by him by reason of such interrupted transit of his goods. I decline, therefore, to affirm this proposition.\n\n5. This proposition is affirmed, with the qualification that I do not say that the defendant was in fault, otherwise than as and for the reason stated in the answer to proposition 3.\n\n6. I decline to affirm this proposition. The exception in the bill of lading is that the carrier shall not be liable \"for loss or damage on any article or property whatever, by fire or other casualty, while in transit, or while in depots or places of transhipment.\" The engagement of the carrier is to assume the custody of the property entrusted to him at the point of shipment and to deliver it at the place of destination, and the obvious intent, as well, I think, as the clear import, of the exception, is to protect him against the consequences of fire during the continuance of his duty as a carrier. His qualified liability is co-extensive with this duty, and he forfeits its protection only by some fault of his own in connection with the casualty to which the exception refers. Nor can I regard it as within the reason of the exception to hold that it is eliminated from the contract when the property in the carrier's charge is wrested from him by a hostile force, which he is unable to resist, and it is consumed in an incendiary fire, [*232] although his exclusion from the possession and control of it may last for two days before it is thus destroyed.\n\n7. I decline to affirm this proposition.\n\n8. I decline to affirm this proposition for the reasons that the petroleum cars were presumably in the usual and proper place for them in the depot yard; that they were at a safe distance from the cars containing the plaintiff's goods, and were there secured by mechanical appliances usually employed for that purpose, that they might lawfully be kept there, and that their removal into contact with the other cars was the act of the incendiary mob which had, for two days before, maintained a forcible mastery of the situation.\n\n9. I decline to affirm this proposition.\n\nUpon the whole case I am of the opinion, and so find, that the loss complained of was caused by fire, while the plaintiff's goods were in transit by the defendant, within the meaning of the exception in the bill of lading; that the defendant is not shown to have been guilty of any negligence by which the efficiency of the exception is in anywise impaired; and hence that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. Judgment will therefore be entered in favor of the defendant."}

{"id": "XOKHH7QNB5G0.txt", "judge": "HUGHES, J.", "plantiff": "Giddings' Ex'rs", "defendant": "Green et al.", "case_title": "Giddings' Ex'rs v. Green et al.", "court": "Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Virginia", "date": "1880", "text": "[*490] The sufficiency of this plea to defeat this suit is the only question before me in this cause. It is a technical defense. There is no principle of law more firmly established than that, where there are assets in one state of a deceased resident of another state, they cannot be collected by suit, except by an executor or administrator having letters of administration from a court of the state in which the assets are sued for. Otherwise, if there should be creditors of the deceased person in such state, they would be driven to a different jurisdiction to assert their claims, and their rights would depend upon the laws of another forum than that in which their rights of action arose. The authorities establishing this principle of law are so numerous that it is useless to cite them. But it may well be doubted whether this principle extends so far as to deny to the personal representative of a decedent, under all circumstances, the right to sue as such in any jurisdiction except that from which his letters of administration issued. Suppose an executor in Ohio has found among the effects of his testator in that state a jeweled watch, or valuable horse, or other specific article of corporeal property, and has put it into his inventory of the testator's effects, and the title to it has become vested in him, and he has become liable for it in Ohio to Ohio creditors; and suppose this article of property is stolen and carried into Virginia, and found in the possession of one of her citizens. Will it be contended that the Ohio executor, who, as such, has the exclusive title to the property, cannot sue for its recovery in Virginia; and can it be pretended that a Virginia executor, who has no title, must be appointed, or, if appointed, must sue for this property not vested by law in him? In such a case the right of action attaches to the person of the particular executor in which the title of the property has vested, and not to his office, considered in the abstract. Story, Confl. Laws, 516, and cases there cited. If such executor, suing in Virginia, describes himself as executor, the words would be descriptio person. So, when an executor has been regularly made plaintiff in a judgment recovered by his testator during his life-time, by substitution of record, in the state wherein his letters were granted and the judgment obtained, then he may sue upon that judgment in another state without taking out letters testamentary therein, just as any other trustee may sue in a state other than that of his residence or citizenship. Greasons v. Davis, 9 Iowa, 219, 225 . So, if an executor appointed in Vermont, of a resident who died there, receives a debt voluntarily paid him by a citizen of New York, due to his testator, that debtor cannot be afterwards sued in New York, by a creditor of the testator or other claimant in the latter state, for the claim which he has thus paid. The reduction of the claim to possession vests the fund in the executor, and makes it a part of the estate in Vermont, and terminates its character as assets in New York, at least so far as to exonerate the New York debtor from liability for it. Story, Confl. Laws, 515, and cases there cited. It has been held that, inasmuch as an executor in one state may assign a chose in action, and thus wholly part with the property in it, his assignee may sue upon the chose in action in another state in his own right, if the statute law of that state [*491] permit an assignee so to sue there, and letters testamentary need not be taken out there. Harper v. Butler, 2 Pet. 239 .\n\nA negotiable note is of the same character, as to the right of suit, with a chose in action assigned and sued upon as just instanced. Negotiable notes partake of the character of personal chattels on account of their transferability. The legal property in them passes by transfer, as it does in chattels. If a negotiable note matures after the death of a testator, as in the case at bar, it becomes vested in his local executor. See Story, Confl. Laws, 355, 359, 517. It is his property, is inventoried by him as such, and the title to it vests in him precisely as what of a watch or a horse vests in him, as part of the home assets of the testator's estate, distributable as all other home assets are, as directed by the law of the particular state. The executor may indorse and deliver it to whom he may please, and such action on his part transfers to the indorsee the same right to sue all over the world as belongs to the holder of any other negotiable paper. Whether he indorses it, or does not, its proceeds or the note itself is home assets, subject exclusively to home distribution under the law of the domicile; and therefore it is maintained by Mr. Justice Story ( Confl. Laws, 517) that if he does not transfer the note by indorsement, but sues upon it himself in another state, he need not take out letters testamentary in the state where the debtor resides, in order to maintain his suit against him. I hold, therefore, that the plea of A. B. Green in this case is not good, and that the suit may proceed in the name of the executors, complainants. If the paper were transferable by indorsement (which includes delivery) when the executors came into possession of it, the fact that the testator wrote his name upon it in his life-time was nugatory, and the personal representative cannot complete the transfer by delivery. He must himself, in his full legal character, indorse the paper; that is, write the transfer on it and deliver it. 1 Daniell, Ch. Pr. 367; Clark v. Boyd, 2 Ohio, 56 ; Clark v. Sigourney, 17 Conn. 511 ; Bromage v. Lloyd, 1 Exch. 32; Insurance Co. v. Leavenworth, 30 Vt. 11 ; Thomp. Bills, 91.\n\nIn the present case, even if I thought it necessary that these complainants should take out letters testamentary in Virginia, this requirement would not invalidate their present proceeding; for it would be competent for them still to do so; and the court would allow them to amend their bill to embrace this new feature in the case, as was done in Swatzel v. Arnold, 1 Woolw. 383 ."}
{"id": "XOKFPJQNB5G0.txt", "judge": "BUTLER, J.", "plantiff": "Carroll", "defendant": "Ertheiler", "case_title": "Carroll v. Ertheiler", "court": "Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania", "date": "April 6, 1880", "text": "Date: April 6, 1880\nJudge: BUTLER, J.\n\nThe bill set forth that complainant had for over 16 years manufactured smoking tobacco, and had adopted, and continuously and exclusively used during that time, a trade-mark, a prominent characteristic trait of which was the arbitrarily selected word-symbol \"Lone Jack;\" that he affixed this trade-mark, by means of printed labels and wrappers, to his smoking tobacco, which was put up in various styles of packages, including the form commonly known as cigarettes; that although the said word-symbol \"Lone Jack\" was generally used in connection with certain words, being advertisements of his name and place of business and other matter, and frequently the name of the specific article and the representation of the bust of a man smoking, still complainant's smoking tobacco came to be popularly known among merchants and consumers [*689] by the peculiar distinctive designation of \"Lone Jack,\" and was bought and sold under that name; that respondent, intending wrongfully to usurp complainant's reputation, and to deceive the public into supposing that they were buying complainant's tobacco, colorably imitated complainant's trade-mark, and in July, 1879, began to affix to goods of substantially the same descriptive properties as complainant's the word-symbol \"Lone Jack,\" and to sell smoking tobacco wrapped in papers and bearing a label containing, as its most prominent characteristic, the said word-symbol, and that the public had been deceived thereby into buying respondent's tobacco, supposing it to have been manufactured by complainant. The bill prayed for an injunction and account.\n\nThe answer denied that complainant had any proprietary or exclusive interest in the word-symbol \"Lone Jack\" by itself, and alleged that complainant's trade-mark only gave him the right to use the words \"Lone Jack\" in connection with the words \"The Celebrated\" above the bust of a man smoking a pipe, and with the words on each side of said bust, \"Or seek no further, for better can't be found,\" and below said bust the words \"Smoking tobacco, manufactured by John W. Carroll, Lynchburg, Virginia.\" It denied that complainant had ever applied said trade-mark to cigarettes, or to any other article than smoking tobacco, or that he had made or sold cigarettes by the name of \"Lone Jack.\" It alleged that what is known by smokers and to the trade as smoking tobacco is a distinct article of merchandise from cigarette tobacco, and cannot be used for the manufacture of cigarettes, and that cigarette tobacco paid a special tax to the United States government. It further alleged that respondent had, in May, 1879, adopted and was entitled to a trade-mark for cigarettes consisting of the words \"Lone Jack\" above and the word \"Cigarettes\" below the figure of the jack of spades, and the name \"Ertheiler & Co., New York,\" below, and \"The best\" below all; and that the sales of cigarettes under this trade-mark were the only sales by defendant complained of by plaintiff. The answer further denied that there [*690] was any resemblance between the trade-marks, or any attempt at imitation; or that respondent had any intention to usurp complainant's reputation, or deceive the public; or that the public were deceived. Both parties filed affidavits in support of the facts respectively alleged in the bill and answer.\n\n\n\nWilliam Henry Browne and George Harding, for complainant.\n\n\n\nField, Dorsheimer, Bacon & Deyo, for respondent.\n\n\nBUTLER, J. It would be unwise to say more at this time than is necessary to explain the action of the court in disposing of the interlocutory motion now before it. The plaintiff's exclusive right to the trade-mark, as a designation of his smoking tobacco, is not doubted.\n\nThe defence rests upon a denial--first, that the defendant has used the trade-mark; and, second, that he has used it as a designation of \"smoking tobacco.\" The second branch may, most conveniently, be noticed first. While the revenue laws, for purposes of taxation, distinguished between smoking tobacco and cigarettes, there is, we believe, no substantial difference. Cigarettes consists of smoking tobacco, similar in all material respects to that used in pipes. The circumstance that a longer \"cut\" than that commonly used in pipes is most convenient for cigarettes is not important, nor that the tobacco is smoked in paper instead of pipes. It may all be used for either purpose, and is all embraced in the term \"smoking tobacco.\"\n\nWe do not believe the public or the trade draw such a distinction as the defendant sets up. We have not overlooked the statements contained in his affidavits, but the method pursued in obtaining this testimony, generally, does not recommend it to our confidence. The affidavits seem to have been prepared without seeing the witnesses, and sent over the country to be signed by those who might be found willing to sign them. They are, generally, similar in language, and printed. This method of obtaining testimony is not worthy of encouragement. If the public and trade draw such a distinction, and, therefore, do not suppose the defendant's cigarettes to be made of the plaintiff's tobacco, (and the defendant [*691] so understands,) why does he adopt the designation by which this tobacco is familiarly known, and persist in using it?\n\nThe dominating characteristic of the plaintiff's trade-mark is the name \"Lone Jack.\" His tobacco has come to be known and described by this name, throughout the country, to such an extent that the accompanying device has ceased to be important, if it ever was so,--doubtless rarely observed, and slightly remembered. At home and abroad, to the trade and the public, it is familiarly known as \"Lone Jack,\" and is thus designated as the plaintiff's manufacture by purchasers and sellers.\n\nThe defendant's application of this name to his smoking tobacco is an adoption and use of the essential part of the plaintiff's trade-mark. Surrounding it with a different device signifies nothing to the public, who attach no importance to the device of the plaintiff. The defendant's name upon the cigarettes, if recognized, (and it would not be without close inspection,) would not inform the public that the tobacco is not of the plaintiff's manufacture. That the defendant's act is calculated to mislead can hardly be doubted; that it has misled, the plaintiff's affidavits, we think, show; and the inference that the defendant supposed it would mislead, and intended it should, cannot well be avoided. Why otherwise did he adopt this particular name? He knew it to be the recognized designation of the plaintiff's tobacco, which had become popular with consumers and the trade. Did he not expect the public to be influenced thereby and his business increased? An affirmative answer cannot well be avoided. If he did not, however, the injunction will do him no harm, for he has not yet had time to establish a reputation of his own under this name.\n\nWhether the plaintiff commenced putting up his tobacco in the form of cigarettes before the defendant applied the designation \"Lone Jack\" to his cigarettes need not be considered at this time.\n\nThe law involved is, we believe, well settled, and is so fully stated in every aspect suggested by the learned counsel for the defendant in McLane v. Fleming, 6 Otto, 245 , and [*692] Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Wilson, 3 Law Reports, (appeal cases,) 376, that no more is deemed necessary than a reference to these cases. A preliminary injunction as prayed for will be granted.\n\nAn injunction was subsequently issued restraining respondent, until the further order of the court, from selling cigarettes or smoking tobacco in any form bearing the trade-mark \"Lone Jack.\"\n\n* Reported by Frank B. Prichard, Esq., of the Philadelphia bar."}

Williams.", "court": "Commissioner's Court of the Eastern District of New York", "date": "1880", "text": "Date: 1880\nJudge: ALLEN\n\nThe defendant was arrested upon the complaint of Anthony Comstock, agent of the Society for the Suppression of Vice, upon the charge of sending an obscene letter through the mail. An examination took place before United States Commissioner J. J. Allen, for the purpose of determining whether there was sufficient cause to send the case to the grand jury.\n\n\nALLEN, Commissioner. The defendant is charged with having violated the provisions of section 3893, U. S. Rev. St., as amended by section 1, act of July 12, 1876, ( 19 U. S. St. 90.) The portion of the statute to which the charge relates is as follows:\n\n\"Every obscene, lewd, or lascivious book, pamphlet, picture, paper, writing, print, or other publication of an indecent character, * * * and every letter upon the envelope of which, or postal card upon which, indecent, lewd, obscene * * * terms or language may be written or printed, are [*485] hereby declared to be non-mailable matter. * * * And any person who shall, knowingly, deposit, or cause to be deposited, for mailing or delivery, anything declared by this section to be non-mailable matter, * * * shall be deemed guilty,\" etc.\n\nThe particular act complained of is the depositing in the mail of the Greenpoint station, Brooklyn, on or about September 23, 1879, an obscene and indecent letter, enclosed in an envelope, addressed to Mr. George Rowland, of Greenpoint.\n\nSeveral questions are involved in this case: Is the letter referred to obscene or indecent? Is it such an one as is embraced by the statute? Was it deposited in the mail? And is the evidence such as to justify the belief that the defendant violated the statute as alleged? The letter is evidently obscene and indecent. Obscene matter is that which tends to deprave and corrupt the morals of those whose minds are open to such influences. This is the test given by Chief Justice Cockburne in Regina v. Hicklin, (L. R. 3 Q. B. 360 ,) and adopted in later cases ( U. S. v. Bennett, S. D. N. Y. 1879.) In the case of Heywood, (Mass.,) an obscene writing was defined as one offensive to decency, indelicate, impure, and an indecent one, as one unbecoming, immodest, unfit to be seen. Applying these tests, it is manifest that the letter in question is both obscene and indecent.\n\nThe proof of deposit in the mail consists of the postmark upon the envelope, and the testimony of the post-office officials. Both the English and American courts have held that postmarks afford presumptive proof of deposit in the mail, and, although some effort has been made to show that these postmarks might have been affixed otherwise than by the postal officials, there is sufficient evidence that the letter was deposited in the mail as charged.\n\nThe question next to be considered is whether the letter referred to is shown by the evidence to be within the scope of the law. The offence charged is statutory, and the determination of this question depends upon the construction to be given to the statute upon which the charge is based. I [*486] find no reported case in which this precise question has been discussed and decided, and it will be necessary, therefore, to refer to the series of legislation upon the subject. The act of March 3, 1865, section 16, provided that \"no obscene book, pamphlet, picture, print, or other publication of a vulgar and indecent character\" should be admitted into the mails, and punished their deposit therein. The act of June 8, 1872, section 148, added to the prohibited matter \"any letter upon the envelope of which, or postal card upon which, scurrilous epithets may have been written or printed,\" and prescribed a penalty for deposit of any \"such obscene publications.\" Then followed the acts of March 3, 1873, and July 12, 1876, which will be referred to hereafter.\n\nIt is evident that no statute, prior to 1873, declared an obscene private letter contraband. Such a letter is not a \"book,\" \"pamphlet,\" \"picture,\" or \"print,\" and is not covered by the words \"other publication,\" because they refer only to the classes specifically named.\n\nIn the case of Woodhull, (S. District N. Y., June, 1873,) Judge Blatchford held that as the word \"newspaper\" was not mentioned in the act of 1872, it was not included within the meaning of the words \"other publications;\" that the statute being penal, must be strictly construed, and it meant that, with other publications of the same character, books, pamphlets, and prints were included. In the act of 1876 the language is \"obscene book, paper, writing, print, or other publication,\" which means, according to the rule of construction laid down in the Woodhull Case, that among the publications prohibited were obscene books, writings, and prints. It would seem, therefore, that congress intended the statute to embrace only such writings as are \"publications\" within the meaning of the law.\n\nA \"publication\" is defined in the dictionaries as a book or writing published, especially one offered for sale or to public notice; and to publish is defined to issue, to make known what before was private, to put into circulation. Writings are either printed matter or manuscript. The idea of publicity, of circulation, of intended distribution, seems to be inseparable [*487] from the term \"publication.\" That only such papers and writings as partake of this character were intended to be declared contraband, seems to be indicated by a further review of the series of legislation upon the subject. The words \"paper\" and \"writing\" first appear in the act of 1873, the title of which is \"An act for the suppression of trade in and circulation of obscene literature and articles of immoral use.\" The statute is thus declared to be directed only to such literature and articles as are intended for sale and circulation. Section 1 of this act imposes a penalty upon any one who, in any place within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, \"shall sell, give away, exhibit, or otherwise publish, or have in possession for such purpose, any obscene book, pamphlet, paper, writing, or shall advertise the same for sale.\"\n\nThis section does not punish the preparation of an obscene paper or writing, but the publishing it after it is prepared; nor does it forbid the possession of the same, but possession with intent to publish; thus showing clearly that congress did not intend that the preparation of a paper or writing should be regarded as the publication of it. The next section provides that \"no obscene book, pamphlet, picture, paper, print, or other publication,\" etc., shall be mailable, and is merely a declaration that the mails shall not be used for the accomplishment of the purposes prohibited in section 1; section 3 forbids the importation of the articles and things previously mentioned; section 4 punishes government officers who abet the violation of the act; and section 5 authorizes a search for and seizure of the things named, by United States marshals, that they may be condemned.\n\nThe statute was intended to be complete in its scope, and to prevent\u2014First, the sale and circulation; second, the distribution by mail; third, the importation of the literature and articles referred to; and, fourth, the seizure and condemnation of the same; and, in order to determine what things are embraced by the act, its several provisions must be construed together.\n\nIt will be noticed that \"writing\" appears only in section 1, [*488] as also do \"drawing,\" \"representation,\" \"circular;\" but it cannot be presumed that congress intended to prohibit the sale and circulation of these things, and yet permit them to be distributed by mail. Manifestly they were intended to be covered by the general designations used in section 2, and the latter, therefore, indicate to what class the things specified in section 1 must belong in order to be within the scope of the statute. Hence, although the word \"writing\" is not in section 2, it was evidently intended by that section to exclude from the mails all obscene writings which were \"publications\" of the classes known as books, pamphlets, or papers; and I think it manifest, from what has been said, that congress did not regard a private letter as such a publication, or within the act of 1873. If covered by that act, private letters could be examined and destroyed under the authority given marshals to search for and seize \"any such article or thing.\" So far as \"papers\" or \"writings\" are concerned, the act of 1873 does not appear to have been changed by subsequent legislation. Section 2 of the act was revised by the act of July 12, 1876, in which the word \"writing\" was inserted in the list of non-mailable publications; but this was evidently done, not to enlarge the scope of the act of 1873, but because, in incorporating that act into the Revised Statutes of 1873, its several sections had been separated and classified, and, as they could not readily be viewed together as explaining each other, so much of section 1 was repeated in each separate section as was deemed necessary to make the meaning of the law clear. This repetition of the word \"writing\" in the Revision, therefore, did not render non-mailable any writing not made so by the act of 1873, or not belonging to the classes of publications, the sale and circulation of which that act sought to suppress. Similar repetitions of words of section 1 are found in the other, now separated, sections. Section 1 became section 5389 of the Revised Statutes, in the division of crimes; section 2 appears in section 3893, among the postal laws; section 4 is found in section 1785, relating to the duties of officers; and section 5 is section 2492, concerning imports. In each of these the words \"paper,\" \"writing,\" etc., now appear, [*489] although previously section 1 alone contained a full list of the prohibited articles, the other sections referring back to it by general terms. These separated sections also serve to further explain the meaning of the original statute.\n\nSection 1785, Rev. St., provides that whoever, being \"an officer, agent, or employe of the government of the United States, shall knowingly aid or abet any person engaged in any violation of any of the provisions of law prohibiting importing, advertising, dealing in, or exhibiting or sending or receiving by mail obscene or indecent publications, * * * shall be deemed guilty,\" etc. The language of this section shows that the provisions of law prohibiting sending or receiving by mail written or printed matter relates to publications. The words \"paper\" and \"writing\" appear in each of the above sections relating to the dealing in and circulating, the mailing, the importing, and the seizing and destroying of obscene matter; and those sections, being intimately related and contributory to one design, it must be assumed that all refer to the same class of papers and writings, and to none other. As private letters are evidently not among the papers or writings to which some of those sections relate, it follows that congress did not intend to embrace them within any of the provisions referred to. The term \"publication,\" in the Revision, must also be presumed to have the same meaning as in the original act, wherein it expresses more than mere preparation, and possesses the added characteristic of proposed circulation and distribution. The latter part of the statute, relating to the taking of these contraband articles from the mails, also carries out this idea: it punishes not the mere taking, but the taking \"for the purpose of circulating or disposing of\" them. If it be urged that mailing a letter to another is a publication of it, the reply is that its mailable or non-mailable character must be determined prior to its admission to the mails, and before such a publication can occur.\n\nThere appears, therefore, little room for doubt, in view of the apparent intention of congress as expressed in the series of legislation referred to, that the scope of the statute does [*490] not extend to papers or writings which are not publications within the evident meaning of the law. The object of congress has been declared by the United States supreme court to be to refuse the facilities of the mails for the \"distribution of matter deemed injurious to the public morals.\" Ex parte Jackson, 96 U. S. 727 . And in the case of Bennett, S. Dist. N. Y., 1879, it was said to be the prevention of the use of the mails \"for the purpose of disseminating obscene literature.\" Both these declarations seem to except from the purview of the statute written communications of a private, personal nature, emanating from a single person, and exhibiting no purpose of going beyond the one directly addressed. As the court, in the Woodhull Case cited, remarked of newspapers, so it may here be said of private letters, that if it were the intention to include them nothing could have been easier than to add those words to the general list; but, on the contrary, the statute specifically refers to letters of a single class as contraband. After declaring indecent papers and writings non-mailable, it adds, \"and every letter upon the envelope of which, or postal card upon which, indecent, lewd, obscene * * terms or language may be written.\" This addition would be needless if the words \"paper\" and \"writing\" were intended to cover every paper and all written matter, because postal cards and envelopes on which obscene language is written are both obscene papers and obscene writings. Hence, the special designation of postal cards and letters indicates that they were not embraced by the preceding words, \"paper, writing, or other publications,\" and that it was not intended to exclude from the mails other letters than those so specifically described.\n\nThe reference to letters shows that congress had them in mind, and, by designating a certain class of them as non-mailable, there seems to have been an intention to confine the prohibition to that class, namely, those wherein the indecent matter is exposed to the inspection of others than the person directly addressed\u2014a distinction in accordance with the spirit of the statute before suggested. The statute is a penal one, and must be strictly construed, and cannot be [*491] extended by implication even for the purpose of embracing cases clearly within the mischief intended to be remedied. Terrell v. Atwill, 1 Blatchf. 151 . A strict construction of the statute in question leaves little doubt as to its proper interpretation. Desirable as it may be that private letters containing indecent expressions should not be admitted to the mails, congress may not have seen fit to exclude them. Until 1865 it permitted the admission to the mails of all sorts of obscene and indecent matter, and it was not until 1873 that it excluded newspapers containing indecent articles; and it may well be doubted whether it has as yet deemed it wise to interfere with private letters which are outwardly unobjectionable. To determine whether the letter in question is within the scope of the statute, it is necessary to refer both to the letter itself and to the testimony relating to it. There is nothing indecent upon the envelope. It is addressed to the person to whom it was delivered, sealed, from the mail, and was first opened by him, and there is no evidence that, prior to that time, the letter enclosed, which is in the form of a private letter, was seen by or known to any one but its author.\n\nThere seems to be no doubt that such a letter is not among the class of letters which congress has declared non-mailable, and, if this view of the law is correct, the deposit of it in the mail was not a violation of the statute. If there is a fair doubt whether the act charged is embraced within the prohibition of the statute, the doubt is to be resolved in favor of the defendant. United States v. Morris, 14 Pet. 464 ; United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76 ; United States v. Whittier, 18 Alb. L. J. 110.\n\nThis conclusion renders it unnecessary for me to review the evidence bearing upon the question by whom the letter referred to was deposited in the mail, or to express an opinion thereon.\n\nThe case was not given to the grand jury."}

To have the jurisdictional question tested, the order to show cause issued in this case; and now, on the motion to discharge said order, the court is to determine whether, by force of the act of 1875, the powers not theretofore existing as to an original proceeding for mandamus have been granted. All the decisions prior to that act, it is conceded, denied such jurisdiction in the United States circuit courts; but it is contended that the act of 1875 not only enlarged the jurisdiction as to parties, but also as to the subject-matter and forms or modes of proceeding. The language invoked is that said courts \"shall have original cognizance, etc., of all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity.\"\n\nThere still remain on the statute book sections 629 and 716, which are substantially a reproduction of sections 11 and 14 of the judiciary act, (1789,) unless their restrictions are repealed by the act of 1875. The latter enlarged the jurisdiction as to parties, but used the same language as to the nature of the suits which had prevailed since 1789, viz.: \"All suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity,\" under which the United States supreme court has uniformly held that, taken in connection with section 14 of the original act\u2014now 716 of the Revised Statutes\u2014the power claimed did not exist. It is held, therefore, that the United States circuit courts have not, under the statutes of 1875, any other jurisdiction in mandamus proceedings than theretofore existed. The same reasons that caused congress originally to withhold the authority exist more forcibly to-day, growing out of the large multiplication of offices and corporations.\n\nThe motion to discharge the order is granted.\n\nIf the parties wish to further test the question a demurrer to the jurisdiction may be interposed and sustained."}

The Steam Tug \"Bob Connell\" and others.", "court": "USCCPA_W", "date": "March 5, 1880.", "text": "Date: March 5, 1880.\nJudge: MCKENNAN, J.\n\nJames I. Kay, for libellant.\n\n\n\nP. C. Knox, J. & J. H. Barton and J. H. Miller, for respondents.\n\n\nMCKENNAN, J. In view of the growing tendency of the decisions of the supreme court towards the expansion of admiralty jurisdiction in this country, I think a claim for lockage in a public navigable river may properly be regarded as a subject of a maritime nature, and so cognizable by a court of admiralty. It has not been authoritatively so classified, but the reasons for such classification apply as decisively to it as to other recognized subjects of admiralty cognizance. Lockage is a service which is purely maritime, and which respects rights and duties appertaining to commerce and navigation; and, as necessary to the use of artificial appliances by which navigation is facilitated, it is not only beneficial to commerce, but is indispensable to enable vessels engaged in it to proceed on their voyage.\n\nI have no doubt, therefore, from the nature of the appellant's claim, that it is within the general jurisdiction of the district court as a court of admiralty.\n\nHow may it be enforced, by a libel in rem or in personam? If the former, it can only be on the basis of a lien against the vessel to which credit was given. A lien arises:\n\n1. By virtue of the general maritime law, in view of the nature of the claim or service, and the circumstances surrounding it.\n\n2. By virtue of a local statute expressly creating it.\n\nAs to the latter of these classes it is only necessary to say [*219] that a contract for lockage is not specially secured by any statute in Pennsylvania, and hence that the claim here has no statutory lien.\n\nNor has it any stronger foothold in the general maritime law. From The General Smith, in 4 Wheaton, 438-443 , down through a long series of cases to The Lottawana, in 21 Wallace, 558 , the supreme court has adhered to the rule that a lien is not incident to materials, or supplies, or maritime service, furnished to a vessel in her home port, which is defined to be any place within the limits of the state to which the vessel belongs. Repeated efforts have been made to shake these decisions, as resting upon an irrational distinction between domestic and foreign vessels, but the court has firmly adhered to them. In The Lottawana, 578, an impressive effort was made in this direction, but the court met it by saying: \"And according to the maritime law, as accepted and received in this country, we feel bound to declare that no such lien exists as is claimed by the appellees in this case. The adjudications in this court before referred to, which it is unnecessary to review, are conclusive on this subject; and we see no sufficient ground for disturbing them.\" So, also, in Ex parte Easton, 95 U. S. 69-75 , it is affirmed that a lien for wharfage furnished to a domestic vessel does not exist. The court said: \"These remarks * * * are abundantly sufficient to demonstrate that the contract for wharfage is a maritime contract, for which, if the vessel or water craft is a foreign one, or belongs to a port of a state other than that where the wharf is situated, a maritime lien arises against the ship or vessel in favor of the proprietor of the wharf.\" It cannot be doubted that lockage is of the same general nature and in the same category with the claims involved in these cases, and hence that like conditions are essential in all of them to the existence of a lien upon the vessel on whose credit they are supplied.\n\nThe vessel in this case was owned at Pittsburgh, and that was her home port. The claim in question is for lockage service in passing the vessel through locks in the Monongahela river, within the state of Pennsylvania, erected and [*220] owned by the Monongahela Navigation Company. It is thus a service rendered to the vessel at her home port, compensation for which is not enforceable by a libel in rem.\n\nAs the fund for distribution arising from the sale of the vessel was insufficient to cover the liens upon it, the appellant's claim was rightfully excluded from any participation in it, and its intervening libel must, therefore, be dismissed, with costs, and it is so ordered."}

Sheffield, for libellants.\n\n\nKNOWLES, D. J. This is a libel suit for salvage services, in which a decree of condemnation, on default and contumacy, was entered, October 8, 1879, under which decree the res was sold at public auction, on the twenty-fourth of October, for the sum of $700. This sum was paid into the registry to abide the order of the court, and there it still remains, less the sum of $115.72, being the marshal's fees, paid to him on his petition, with the assent of the libellants, and of all other persons claiming an interest in the said fund.\n\nNo claimant or intervenor has made himself a party to the suit, but, by arrangement and agreement between the libellants and one Harris Pendleton, conceded to have been sole owner of the steamer libelled, he was permitted to appear and make defence against the allowance to the libellants of aught more than a nominal sum in compensation for their alleged salvage services. Upon the question thus presented the parties have been fully heard, with their respective pleas, allegations, and evidence, and the court's judgment and determination thereupon I will proceed to state. Of the facts substantiated by the evidence submitted by the parties respectively, only a few need be here stated in detail. That evidence shows satisfactorily that the libellants' claim for salvage was well founded\u2014in fact, indisputable; their proceedings throughout having been in consonance with the requirements of law, and the dictates of sound judgment and of nautical skill. It showed, also, that, although the res might have been, as claimed, worth at least $2,100 when lying moored at Noack on the seventeenth or eighteenth of August, she brought, at a judicial sale in October, at which both the said Harris Pendleton and the libellants were present, only the said sum of $700. And yet, [*813] further, it showed that, to raise the res to the surface and put her in a condition to float in Newport harbor, the libellants, with the knowledge and tacit, if not expressed, assent of the authorized agent of the said Harris Pendleton, incurred a debt of $350 to a Captain Waters, a wrecker and diver of Newport, for which he holds them to be solely his debtors, they acknowledging their liability.\n\nNow, that the libellants are entitled to recover this sum expended in caring for the res while in their charge and custody as salvors, must be conceded, while it follows that, after allowing this to be an indisputable claim against the fund, there still remains but $234.28 unappropriated, out of which to pay costs yet untaxed, estimated at $56.70, and whatever, if anything, shall be adjudged due the salvors in addition to the said sum of $350.\n\nIn view of these and of other facts in proof, I am of opinion that the libellants are entitled to an award of $125 for their salvage services, in addition to the said sum of $350 expended in the raising and repairing the res. A less sum would not be a reasonable compensation; a larger, considering of how little value the vessel proved to be after a necessary outlay of $350 upon her, would be out of reason. That the libellants may say that, could they have foreseen the result, they would have passed by on the other side, as did the Lereti, and left the crippled and helpless boat to the mercy of the wind and waves, is not improbable; and equally probable it is that the owner, Harris Pendleton, may say that better had it been for him had she gone to pieces with the dredge to which he prudently or imprudently made her fast at Noack on the eighteenth of August. But to querulous utterances like these, from whichsoever party, it seems sufficient to reply, that in the judgment of the court any other result would be unaccordant with sound precedents, and with the teachings of all approved text-writers on admiralty law and practice."}

De Mott", "court": "Commissioner's Court of the District of New Jersey", "date": "1880", "text": "[*479] PATTERSON, Commissioner. There is nothing of a criminal nature involved in this information. The defendant appeared without any formal service of the warrant to bring him before the commissioner. Nor will any commitment or trial on the charge affect unfavorably his character or standing in the community where he resides.\n\nThe allegation is met, contested, and denied fully and squarely on the part of the defendant. His defence, virtually, is a justification of the acts on which he is summoned here, because he was the agent of the legal owner of the land where the offence was committed, who had been placed in actual possession thereof, under the order of a competent judicial tribunal, executed by the proper officer. It is said the judgment thus obtained against the railroad company was founded on the fact that they never had made any compensation to the owner for the right of way taken for the construction of their track. This is not material to be shown. The decree of the court is sufficient to establish the legal right of the owner to the possession of the property. Nor could the fact of want of remuneration by the relators to such owner, if proven in the case, enter as an element for consideration here. The United States were no party to any laches by the relators in that respect, nor are they alleged to have been or to be cognizant of or privy to that failure by this company, or any preceding organization. In the absence of notice, or of the fact being brought to their knowledge, they would be justified in regarding the title of the relators to the land on which their tracks were laid to be as good as that of any other road over which their mails were carried. They found a road constructed and in running order, and recognized and used it for postal service, just as they do an ordinary highway. To apply the principle of caveat emptor to them in such cases, and say they were bound to look up the title of every railroad and spur and branch, and ascertain if it was clear of claim and cloud, would seem to impair, to a serious extent, the efficiency and benefit of the service.\n\nThat the defendant has proved he was acting as the agent of the legal owner of the premises is clear. There can be [*480] no question as to who holds the legal title. The protection of individual property belongs to the state tribunals, and never has been vested in any other. This owner, for whom the defendant acts, was correct in invoking judicial authority, and appealing to that for protection and relief. That court has decided that the owner was entitled thereto, and the result is here in this certificate of the officer who carried into effect the remedial process. The defendant claims he should be discharged because he was acting under the authority of that order, and that only. He was holding the possession of the land into which he as agent had been put judicially; that was his authority.\n\nTo this the United States reply and say that they do not deny the action of the court, but insist that the authority of the government is paramount. They say: What is alleged on behalf of the defendant may be true, and it may be equally true that the railroad company may never have made compensation to the owner for the right of way, but that is of no moment or consequence to them. Their right is paramount. It is a right they possess under the constitution of the United States, and laws made in pursuance thereof, and those are the supreme law of the land. This road is declared to be a post-route under those laws, and so long as it remains open the United States have a clear right to take and use it for the postal service.\n\nThese are the positions assumed by the parties to this complaint, and it raises the direct question whether federal legislative authority, when applied in this intermediate way, is paramount to the state law, by which only the protection of individual property is assured. It is evident, if each stands firmly on the assumed right, the consequences might be very similar to those which would attend the concussion of an immovable body with one that is irresistible.\n\nI regard the power of the United States, in respect to the transmission of mails, to be supreme and exclusive, when exercised in a direct manner, as it is in cases of bank incorporations. If it is so exercised in postal matters then our laws and the constitution, under which they act, would forbid [*481] their taking private property without compensation. If it is not so exercised they can or should acquire no greater right than is conferred by the state on the person or municipal corporation, or is contained in the franchise of a railway charter, like that of the relators here. Should it be admitted or determined that the United States, under circumstances such as are disclosed by this investigation, can claim an absolute right to continue the carrying of their mail matter upon the tracks and in the cars of the company, it might amount to a virtual confiscation of individual property, and state laws become ineffective for its protection. I am not prepared to sanction so sweeping a claim on the part of the United States.\n\nStill, the latter have acquired a right to the use of the road for the purposes in question that is entitled to consideration, that enters properly as an element for determination, and that cannot be disposed of in the summary and annoying manner developed in this case without inconvenience if not detriment to the public interest. While the United States, primarily, should not be compelled to ascertain whether the company have or not acquired full and clear title, yet, when notified of failure by any persons who claim the right under the judicial sanction of the state, and have been placed in actual possession of part of the premises for any reason, it would disclose a fact that no alleged plea of paramount domain would warrant them in disregarding.\n\nThe owner of the land was delivered possession on the twelfth of February last, under the remedial process of the state court. She takes it, however, subject to the equitable right of third parties, without notice. No notice whatever appears to have been given to the United States or their agents, on behalf of the owner, of the clear legal right and possession thus acquired. Nor does there appear to have been any time allowed for reasonable notice, as the acts upon which this information is based occurred on the 16th. The agents of the owner have proceeded upon the idea that no other rights were involved than their own; at least, that seems to be so from the testimony.\n\n[*482] My opinion is that no ultra or decisive steps should have been taken by the owner at so early a date. On being advised of the facts the authorities of the United States, in equity, would have been compelled to make compensation, or fall back on the bonds of the company. They would have no fair claim to use the road, upon notice of the facts shown here, unless by agreement with the owner. But until such notice their right to carry the mail remained the same as before.\n\nUnder the view I have taken the defendant should not be discharged, simply by reason or virtue of the order of the circuit court of the county of Morris, giving the owner actual possession. It remains to be considered whether he should be held for any of the acts committed on that day\u2014that is, if they constitute the offence in contemplation of the federal statute.\n\nThe defendant denies that such acts on his part come within the federal statute, because they were committed under color of right. But the claim of right is set up, too, on the part of the United States, and the fact is that, under the circumstances, both had color of right. The defendant knew that the relators carried the mail of the United States, and the knowledge of that should have been sufficient to put him on inquiry. I mean on such inquiry that he could have ascertained officially, and as a matter of certainty, on just what trains those mails were transported. He claims, also, that what he did was in ignorance of this being a mail train until informed at the place of obstruction, and the statute makes the gist, the intent, of the offence to consist in knowledge; therefore, what he did cannot be brought within its meaning. There is no direct evidence, one way or the other, as to his knowledge or ignorance of the train in question being a public carrier in the service of the United States. So far as appears inferentially the testimony would be in his favor if standing alone and disconnected. It is shown, however, that he admitted having placed the obstructions on the track\u2014an act which his ignorance of the nature of the train in this respect, at the time, does not excuse or justify, because it was of an extreme and might have been of a dangerous character. It appears, [*483] also, that when informed the mails were carried on the train he did not offer to facilitate the passage of the cars by removing the obstructions he had laid down; but after such had been put away by the employes of the relators he told the conductor to proceed at his peril. I think here is a knowledge and intent manifested to which the words of the statute apply. Had the defendant, on learning at the crossing the true state of facts, cleared or assisted in clearing the tracks, and told the conductor then to proceed, and not forbidden him to go on, the case would have been different. As it is, the testimony shows that the acts of Mr. De Mott, whether before or after full knowledge of all the facts, contributed to delay and obstruct the carrying of mail matter by the railroad company, which at that time clearly was lawful. Nor is the strength of this conclusion weakened by the defendant declining to be examined on his own behalf.\n\nIt is unnecessary, in my judgment, for the United States to prove an actual contract with the company in this preliminary proceeding, or for the latter to have their authority displayed on their cars. It is sufficient that mail bags and pouches be brought to notice, or the fact be announced by the person in charge. This was done here, and it was notice enough to put any person on guard or inquiry.\n\nIt is not without hesitation that I have decided to hold either of these defendants to answer. No doubt they feel aggrieved at the laches or wrong-doing of the company in withholding or retaining the compensation for right of way. Nor am I of the number of those who would extend federal jurisdiction; rather the contrary. It is natural for the owners of land, situated as these have been, to manifest no very friendly feelings toward the relators; still, the rights of others must not be disregarded. The defendants will be held under recognizance in the same amount as now to answer."}

Wire Web Bed Company.", "court": "Circuit Court for the District of Connecticut", "date": "March 18, 1880", "text": "Date: March 18, 1880\nJudge: SHIPMAN, J. \n\nSHIPMAN, J. This is an application for a temporary injunction to restrain an alleged violation of reissued letters patent, [*223] dated May 29, 1877, for an improvement in bedstead frames. The original patent was issued November 30, 1869, to J. M. Farnham, assignor to the plaintiff.\n\nThe validity of the patent has recently been sustained by Judge Blodgett, holding the circuit court for the northern district of Illinois, in three contested cases, which were apparently tried together.\n\nThe claims of the patent are as follows:\n\n1. The combination of the side bars and end bars, and elastic coiled wire, fabric \"D,\" attached only to the end bars, with the end bars of the frame elevated above the side bars, so that the fabric will be suspended above the side bars from end to end of the frame.\n\n2. The combination in a removable bed bottom or bedstead frame, of the side-bars \"A,\" standards or corner pieces \"B,\" end bars \"C,\" and the elastic fabric \"D,\" combined and arranged substantially as and for the purposes specified.\n\n3. The inclined double end bars \"C\" of a bedstead frame, arranged substantially as and for the purposes herein shown and described.\n\n4. The standards \"B,\" constructed as described, arranged longitudinally, adjustable on the side bars of a bedstead frame, to permit the inclined end bars to be set a suitable distance apart, as set forth.\n\nJudge Blodgett, in construing the first two claims by the light of the evidence as to the state of the art, says that while these claims \"may be sustained for the combination of the side rails, standards, end rails, and elastic coiled wire fabric, yet it must be limited to the peculiar kind of side rails, standards and end rails shown, or their manifest equivalents. Side rails, end rails, and elastic coiled wire fabric were old; but the inclined end rail, made in two parts for the purpose of clamping the fabric and holding it suspended by means of the inclination between the points of attachment, seems, so far as the proof of these cases shows, to have been the invention of Farnham. So, too, his 'standards,' or corner pieces, 'B,' are not shown to have been anticipated by any prior user or inventor.\" [*224] The first two claims of the patent are found only in the reissue. The third and fourth claims were in the original patent. Judge Blodgett is evidently of opinion that the end bars of the first claim must be the \"inclined double end bars\" of the third claim, and that the standard of the second claim must be adjustable on the side bars, so as to permit the enclosed end bars to be set a suitable distance apart, substantially as stated in the fourth claim. The point in dispute between the parties in this case, upon the question of infringement, is in regard to the inclination of the end rails. It is admitted that the frame which is produced is a fair sample of the articles made by the defendants. The end rails are certainly inclined, not nearly to such an extent as in the plaintiff's bed frames, but they are plainly inclined, so that the strain of the bed bottom comes upon the double end of the end bar, and the under side of the fabric does not rest substantially upon the end bars. How this inclination is effected was not made clear. I do not think that it results from the strain of the fabric upon an uninclined bar. The bar must be inclined when the frame and the fabric are put together.\n\nUpon the question of novelty the old bed frame which came from Baltimore did not impress me as originally and designedly having inclined end bars. If the end bars are now inclined I think such inclination is the result of wear and tear.\n\nAn injunction should issue against violation of the first and third clauses of claim."}

That to transfer the title to property held by a warehouseman, and for which he has given a regular warehouse receipt, to a party as collateral security for a loan, by indorsement and delivery of the warehouse receipt, it is not necessary that the party receiving the receipt as such collateral shall give notice of the assignment of such receipt to him. Given.\n\n9. That if said Bates and said Bogen were carrying on the pork business together under the name of said Bates, each to have one-half the profits thereof, and the said Bates left the entire management and control of the said business to said Bogen, he, said Bates, cannot plead ignorance of anything relating to the business, or the usual modes of conducting it, or in reference to warehouse receipts used in conducting said business, which was known to the said Bogen. Given.\n\nThe defendant asked for the following special charges:\n\n1. The warehouse receipts of Bates, copied into the petition, were not negotiable, so that their indorsement and delivery by Grant to the bank vested a right of action therein in the bank against Bates for the lard or the value thereof.\n\nRefused, as written; given as follows: \"It did not vest a right of action as upon a negotiable note or bill of exchange, but it did vest in the bank a right to maintain an action for injury to, or conversion of, or for a recovery of, the property.\"\n\n2. The indorsement and delivery of said warehouse receipts by Grant to the bank created no privity of contract between them which prevented Bates from delivering said lard to Grant unless said Bates had notice of said transfer to the bank. Refused.\n\n3. The only effect of said indorsement and delivery of the warehouse receipts by Grant to the bank was to transfer to said bank the title to said lard and the right to its possession, and to constitute said Bates the bailee of said bank, when notified of said transfer to the bank. Refused.\n\n[*708] 4. The stipulation of said warehouse receipts that said lard is subject to the order of Grant on the return of said receipts, is personal between said Bates and Grant, and said Bates could waive their return unless he had notice of their transfer to the bank. Refused.\n\n5. If said First National Bank and the warehouse and place of business of said Bates were in Cincinnati, and the same was known to the representative officers of said bank, and they did not, within a reasonable time after said receipts were transferred to the bank, notify said Bates of said transfer, then said bank was guilty of negligence, and said Bates was not bound to keep said lard, but was justified in delivering it to said Grant. Refused.\n\n6. It is for the jury to determine what is reasonable notice, in view of all the circumstances, and the situation and relation of the parties to each other. Refused.\n\n7. If said bank delayed for six months to notify said Bates of the transfer of said receipts to said bank, knowing that said Bates had his place of business in Cincinnati, such delay was unreasonable, and said Bates cannot be sued for said lard or its value. Refused.\n\n8. If the representative officers of said bank knew, while the bank held said receipts, that said Grant was from time to time obtaining said lard in parcels from said Bates, and did not object, then said bank cannot complain if said Bates delivered all said lard to said Grant. Refused.\n\n9. If said bank officers had good reason to believe, from the course of business of said Grant with said Bates, that said Grant was obtaining said lard in parcels from time to time, while it held said receipts, it was their duty to have inquired about it, and to have notified said Bates, and their failure to do so exonerates said Bates from all liability. Refused.\n\n10. If the custom of pledging such warehouse receipts as collateral upon which to raise money was not known among warehousemen, and said Bates had not notice of any such custom, then he is not bound by it, and it did not prevent said Bates delivering said lard to said Grant, and the transfer [*709] of such receipts to the bank was not binding on said Bates. Refused.\n\n11. If you find that at the time the four notes were given making up the $21,146 claim set up in the petition\u2014of $7,000, dated August 14, 1877; of $9,000, dated August 16, 1877; of $1,500, dated September 4, 1877; and of $1,500, dated September 6, 1877: $19,500\u2014that all of the lard covered by the warehouse receipts copied into the petition had been surrendered to Grant, so that by that time there was none of said lard in Bates' possession, then said pledge in said notes of \"general collaterals\" did not transfer said lard to said bank. Refused.\n\n12. If the bank claims the collaterals under the four notes dated in August and September, 1877, about eight months after they were issued, it was the duty of the bank to have first inquired to ascertain if Bates was in Cincinnati, accessible to them. The lapse of time was such as to put the bank on inquiry about the lard before they could hold Bates responsible. Refused, as written; given as follows: \"If these loans were made at the date of the last notes; if they were the original loans of that date, and Grant had then presented the bank with these collaterals, which had been given some eight months before that date, it was the duty of the bank to make inquiry in regard to them before taking them as collateral security. If, however, they were renewals of original notes, and the receipts had been pledged as collaterals to the original notes, the renewals would carry the pledges with them to the last note of such renewals.\"\n\n\n\nLincoln, Stephens & Slatterly, for plaintiff.\n\n\n\nI. A. Jordan and Jordan, Jordan & Williams, for defendants.\n\n\nSWING, J., (charging jury.) Upon a demurrer to the evidence we have already determined that this action is in the nature of an action of trover, to recover for a wrongful conversion of the property described in the warehouse receipts. It is therefore unnecessary to determine the negotiable properties of warehouse receipts. We may remark, however, that in the commercial sense of the term they are not negotiable [*710] instruments. But it is the well settled law that they are assignable.\n\nIn this view we are required to ascertain, therefore, what rights of property and possession vested in the assignee by the assignment of these warehouse receipts; but in doing this we shall not attempt a review of the numerous authorities cited by learned counsel, or perhaps the more difficult task of reconciling them, as the supreme court of the United States, in Gibson v. Stevens, 3 How. 399 , has declared the law upon this subject, and by this we are governed.\n\nIn that case McQueen & McKay had purchased of certain parties a quantity of pork and flour, which was then in the warehouse of the vendors, and had taken from them a written memorandum of the sale, with a receipt for the money, and an engagement to deliver it in canal boats soon after the opening of canal navigation.\n\nThere was also a written guaranty that the articles should bear inspection. Afterwards McQueen & McKay, in considsideration of advancements made to them by a commission merchant, indorsed and delivered these papers to the merchant, and the question determined by the court was the legal effect of such indorsement and delivery.\n\nChief Justice Taney, in delivering the opinion of the court, says: \"In the opinion of the court it transferred to him the legal title and constructive possession of the property; and the warehouseman, from the time of this transfer, became his bailee, and held the pork and flour for him; the delivery of the evidence of title and the orders indorsed upon them was equivalent to the delivery of the property itself.\"\n\nThe principle of that case applies to the assignment and delivery of warehouse receipts, and was so recognized by Judge Dillon in Harris v. Bradley, 2 Dillon, 285 , and by Justice Miller, of the supreme court, in McNeil v. Hill, 1 Woolworth, 96 .\n\nThe legal title and constructive possession of the property being vested in the assignee of the warehouse receipts, he has the right to maintain an action for its conversion.\n\n[*711] If, therefore, the jury shall find from the evidence in the case that the warehouse receipts in controversy were assigned and delivered by Grant to the plaintiff in pledge as collateral security for any general indebtedness which then or might thereafter exist from Grant to the plaintiff, and said Grant was then indebted, or afterwards became indebted, upon the faith and credit of these papers to the plaintiff, and such indebtedness remains unpaid, and the defendant, without the knowledge and consent of the plaintiff, surrendered the lard to Grant, the plaintiff will be entitled to your verdict for the value of the property, not exceeding the amount of the indebtedness by Grant to the bank, and to this the jury may add a sum equal to 6 per cent. interest to the first day of the term.\n\nThe defendant, having delivered to Grant these receipts, placed it in his power to treat with the plaintiff upon the faith of them, and his statement in them that the lard was to be delivered upon the order of Grant, upon the return of the receipts, was a representation upon which the plaintiff had a right to rely; and if, without the return of such receipts, he delivered this lard to Grant, it will not protect him in this case.\n\nIf the jury find from the evidence in the case that all of the warehouse receipts in controversy were not pledged as general collaterals for general indebtedness of Grant to the plaintiff, but were pledged as special collaterals to secure specific loans, and the loans for which they were pledged have all been paid, then your verdict will be in favor of the defendant; or, if a portion of them were so specifically pledged, the plaintiff would not be entitled to a recovery for those so pledged.\n\nVerdict for plaintiff in the sum of $8,955.20.\n\nGeneral Info\nNotepad\nBCite Analysis\nView All\nComposite Analysis\n\nPositive\nCitation Analysis Summary\n\nPositive 2\n\nDistinguished\n0\n\nCaution\n0\n\nSuperseded by Statute\n0\n\nNegative\n0\nTotal | View All 2\nDirect History Summary\n\nCaution\n0\n\nNegative\n0\nTotal\n0\nResult(s)\nOrder Entered\nDescription of BCite Indicators\nGeneral Information\nTopic(s)\nNegotiable Instruments\nPersonal Property\nClick anywhere in Notepad to add a note.\nDelete\n|\nEdit\nPrevious\nNext\nSave\n|\nCancel\nPrevious\nNext\nDelete Note\nAre you sure you want to delete this note?\n\n\n\nDelete Cancel"}
{"id": "XOKFPRQNB5G0.txt", "judge": "HAMMOND, D. J.", "plantiff": "Behr", "defendant": "Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co.", "case_title": "Behr v. Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co.", "court": "Circuit Court for the Western District of Tennessee", "date": "1880", "text": "[*361] \"If the statements were made deliberately, as if the facts were communicated to counsel with a view to be incorporated in a petition for a divorce, and that the petition, after being prepared, was read over to the party by her counsel, and then adopted and sworn to, they cannot be said to have been made inconsiderately. If the facts were peculiarly within the personal knowledge of the party making the statements, and if she was not ignorant in regard to the truth or falsehood of the facts, then the sworn statements cannot be said to have been made by mistake. A mistake, to have the effect of removing the estoppel, must, at all events, be an innocent and excusable mistakearising from imperfect knowledge or information. If the party knows the facts and misstates them, the estoppel concluded her from showing that her statement was untrue. It is not sufficient to prove that the sworn statement was untrue. There must be some satisfactory reason shown why the truth was not stated in the first instance, and the reason shown must be sufficient to establish the fact that the misstatement was innocently made, under excusable ignorance of the actual facts.\"\n\n\n\nHumes & Poston, for plaintiff.\n\n\n\nEstes & Ellett, for defendant.\n\n\nHAMMOND, D. J. The errors assigned on this motion are that the idea of estoppel was carefully excluded from the jury; that the conclusiveness of the sworn statement was made to depend wholly upon whether or not the plaintiff had been guilty of the offence of wilful and deliberate false swearing, and the court refused to explain, as asked by the instruction, what is meant by \"inconsiderately\" and \"by mistake\" making a false statement. It seems to me that so much of the instruction as sought to explain the meaning of the words \"deliberately,\" \"inadvertently,\" and \"by mistake\" is asking the court to take from the jury certain questions of fact in the case, and to determine them as a matter of law. It is certainly charging the jury upon the weight of the testimony, and expressing an opinion by the court that, under the circumstances stated in the instruction, the sworn statement was amde deliberately, and not inconsiderately and by mistake. [*362] The court may comment on the facts to aid the jury in reaching a just conclusion, but should be careful, in doing so, not to assume to decide the matter of fact itself. Farmers' Bank v. Harris, 2 Humph. 311; Burdell v. Denig, 92 U. S. 716 ; Life Ins. Co. v. Baker, 94 U. S. 610 .\n\nThe charge refused overlooks the proof for the plaintiff, and, calling the attention of the jury to the strong features in the defendant's favor, asks the court to say to the jury that there was deliberation in making the statement, and no inadvertence or mistake. It is not competent for the court, where there is evidence tending to prove the entire issue, although it is conflicting, to give an instruction which shall take from the jury the right of weighing the evidence and determining its force and effect. Weightman v. Washington City, 1 Black, 39, 49 ; Greenleaf v. Birth, 9 Pet. 292 ; Crane v. Morris, 6 Pet. 598 , at p. 617; Lucas v. Brooks, 18 Wall. 436 .\n\nIt is very difficult in some cases to determine whether an instruction is on the facts or the law of a case, and its correctness must depend on the phraseology used; but where the jury is instructed as to what their verdict shall be on the particular point, it is a direction on the effect that they shall give to the evidence. Tracey v. Swartout, 10 Pet. 80 .\n\nA careful reconsideration of this charge strengthens the conviction I entertained at the time it was refused, that it is a partial statement of the facts, accompanied with an expression of opinion by the court as to the effect of those particular facts upon the general fact in disputenamely, whether Mrs. Behr made her statement under oath deliberately, and without inadvertence or mistake. The charge was therefore properly refused.\n\nThe other errors assigned proceed upon the theory that the petition for divorce was an estoppel, and the court erred in not saying so to the jury. Undoubtedly the supreme court of Tennessee, in Hamilton v. Zimmerman, 5 Sneed, 40, 47, calls the principle which concludes a party by his sworn statement erroneously, I think, when applied to a case like this, an, estoppel; and the subsequent cases, following the language of that case, continue to call it so. Cooley v. Steele, 2 Head, 605, 608 ; [*363] Tipton v. Powell, 2 Cald. 19, 23; McCoy v. Pearce, Thomp. Cas. 145, 148; Seay v. Ferguson, 1 Tenn. Ch. 287; Ament v. Brennan, Id. 431; Nelson v. Claybrook, (Jackson, 1880,) MSS. not yet reported.\n\nBut all these cases show that it is not an estoppel, because, with one accord, they say that, \"if made inconsiderately or by mistake, the party ought certainly to be relieved from the consequences of his error.\" Now, the distinguishing feature of an estoppel is that under no circumstances can it be averred against; it is not susceptible of explanation and often speaks against the truth, and for this reason has been regarded as odious. It was given that name \"because a man's own act or acceptance stoppeth or closeth up his mouth to allege or plead the truth.\" Bigelow, Estop. 44. Such a sworn admission may become an estoppel, as it may, whether sworn to or not, if parties act on it, or would be prejudiced by it; and, perhaps, in cases where no explanation can be given, and the party is caught in deliberately attempting to cross himself in swearing two contrary ways about the same fact, it may, in one sense, be called an estoppel to hold him to his first oath and not permit him to gainsay it. But this very case shows that it is misleading to call it so, and because it has been done we are now asked to predicate more upon the name given than is justified by the cases so much relied on, and to extend the principle settled by them far beyond what the supreme court ever intended.\n\nIt would make a most odious estoppel to forever hold a party to a falsehood, whether any one has been injured by it or not. After all, it is only a question of the force and effect of the petition for divorce as a part of the proof, and when once it is admitted that, under any circumstances, the contrary can be shown, it cannot be called an estoppel; and it seems to me to be giving the adverse party an unfair advantage to call it so, and likely to mislead the jury to the detriment of one who may be innocent of false swearing. In deference to these cases, which have established a rule of evidence binding on this court, as well as all others in Tennessee, I charged the jury that the plaintiff here was bound [*364] by her oath unless she could show, to the satisfaction of the jury, that she had not wilfully made a false oath in the first instance. This is all that the cases cited mean, in my opinion, and all else that is claimed for them is based upon an inference drawn from the use of the word \"estoppel.\" I have found none, and doubt if any cases elsewhere will support the doctrine that a man is ever bound by a false oath so that he cannot show the truth as between himself and others who are strangers, and have been neither injured nor prejudiced by the original falsehood.\n\nThe general rule elsewhere is not in accordance with the Tennessee cases. 1 Greenl. Ev. 210-212. But in the charge I gave to the jury I have followed the cases strictly in all except calling the principle enunciated an estoppel. It is immaterial by which name it is called, perhaps, but more was sought to be implied from the word than the cases themselves justified, and it seemed to me necessary to discard it as misleading. In view of what was actually said to the jury on the subject, it seems to me that no error was committed of which the defendant can complain.\n\nThe fact that the jury were told that they could not look to the proof at large unless they acquitted the plaintiff of any intentional and wilful false swearing, it is argued, called for a trial as if upon an indictment for perjury, and the jury were led to believe that they would, by finding against her, substantially fasten upon her the odium of perjury or false swearing, and were thereby led to prejudice the defendant's case by giving more effect to the plaintiff's proof than they should have done, and less to that of the defendant than they would have done if they had been told that they must simply determine whether she had made the oath deliberately and with full knowledge of the facts, or under circumstances showing that she made it inadvertently or by mistake.\n\nThere is much force in this objection to the charge, and it illustrates the inconvenience of applying the analogy of estoppel to the mere process of weighing testimony. The cases cited all show that there is a preliminary question to be tried, namely, whether there was an innocent mistake made. It is [*365] to be determined whether the party shall, in obedience to public policy, be precluded from contradicting his original oath. He is not to be so precluded unless he has, deliberately and with full knowledge, taken the oath without inadvertence or mistake on his part. If he has done this he cannot contradict or offer proof of others to contradict it. It is in the nature of a penalty, and a very serious one, for false swearing. It seems to me plain that it is proper to say to the jury that, in trying this question, they must find a wilful and deliberate false swearing to justify them in inflicting it. Nothing less should work the serious consequence of closing the plaintiff's mouth, so that, although her husband had been, in fact, a drunkard for only a year, for example, she must stand by her false statement that he had been such for four years, and thereby lose a policy to which there is no defence if she could show the truth.\n\nThe charge given is a necessary result of the doctrine invoked, and the law of these cases, in my opinion, requires that this conclusiveness of the false oath shall not obtain unless the public policy against false swearing requires it. I sought to avoid the effect complained of in the charge, by telling the jury that after they had determined the preliminary question in favor of the plaintiff, they would then look at the admission under oath as an admission of great weight, and determine the force and effect of it in behalf of the defendant. The charge is very favorable to the defendant in that respect, and I think the jury understood that after they had tried the question of wilful false swearing, they should give the petition for divorce the fullest weight it was entitled to as an admission by her going to prove the defendant's case. I have no doubt from the proof that the plaintiff did make a mistake in swearing that her husband had been a drunkard four years, and think it is fairly proved that he was a temperate man when he took out the policy. The proof is not so clear as to the extent of his subsequent habits, but the jury has found that they did not impair his health or produce delirium tremens, and I am satisfied with the finding, as also upon the issue of suicide.\n\n[*366] It is plain, therefore, that in this case the plaintiff, in her petition for divorce, made statements which were not true, yet would defeat her recovery on this policy. It not is difficult to apply the rule of public policy, call it an estoppel if you will, to a case where the principle of protecting the courts against false swearing is called for by the facts developed; but, on the other hand, when the proof tends to show an unfortunate misstatement of the facts, it becomes a matter of serious concern to so direct the jury that they shall not hold the party to the misstatement without a clear case which calls for such punishment. On the whole, I am satisfied with the verdict, and overrule the motion for a new trial."}

This contract being void, had the railroad company in this case the right to repossess itself of the telegraph line, and exclude the defendant therefrom, without process of law?\n\nIn the Omaha case the circuit judge held that that company could not. The seizure of property from the possession of another, even though the title and right of possession be in the taker, at so early an hour as 2 o'clock in the morning\u2014as was the case here\u2014is not calculated to create the most favorable impression on a court of equity, and it raises a doubt whether such proceedings are prompted solely by a quickened conscience of duty to the government or the public, especially when that conscience has suddenly awakened from a Rip Van Winkle sleep of 13 years.\n\nIt is contended by the defendant, with much force, that, even though this contract be void, the plaintiff had no legal or equitable right to take possession of the property, against defendant's consent, without legal proceedings, and the more so as a part of the property taken, to-wit, 12 instruments and one wire, were, at least, the sole property of the defendant.\n\n[*420] If I were passing upon the legality of this contract as an original question, and had any doubt of its invalidity, I should follow this rule as the most equitable and the safest, until a final hearing on the merits could be had. My understanding of the law is this: If this contract is ultra vires the railroad company, or is against public policy, it is absolutely void, and, so far as it is executory, neither party can maintain an action against the other for its breach. Nor can either party bring it forward to sustain or defeat a right of possession of property obtained under it, and if it involves any moral delinquency or turpitude, as contra bonos mores, the parties being in pari delicto, the courts leave them just where it finds them, and neither party has any standing in court for legal or equitable relief. Thomas v. City of Richmond, 12 Wall. 349, 354 ; Chitty on Contracts, (10th Am. Ed.) 709-732; Roll v. Roquet, 4 Ohio, 400, 419; Moore v. Adams, 8 Ohio, 372 ; Dixon v. Olmstead, 9 Vt. 310 ; Foote v. Emmerson, 10 Vt. 338 ; Buck v. Albee, 26 Vt. 184 ; U. S. Bank v. Owens, 2 Pet. 527, 538 .\n\nThere is, however, a distinction made where the contract was in no respect immoral, or merely malum prohibitum. In such cases the courts have inquired into the relative delinquency of the parties, and administered justice between them. Thomas v. Richmond, supra ; Lowell v. Railroad Co. 23 Pick. 32 .\n\nBut that is not the relief the defendant is seeking here. It is asking an enforcement of the contract. It is true, in the Omaha case Judge McCrary ordered the property placed back into the possession of the telegraph company until an accounting should be had between the parties. In that case the railroad company had received stock of the telegraph company of the value of $150,000, and the railroad company had taken no legal proceedings to have the contract annulled, nor offered to account with the telegraph company, or return the consideration received.\n\nIt appeared equitable that it should account for what it had received, and under the equities of the case the judge made the order of restitution.\n\nThe facts in this case are quite different. At the same [*421] time the plaintiff took possession of the line, which was done by removing the pins in the switch board of the Atchison office, and thus disconnecting the defendant's wire, it filed its bill asking that the contract be decreed null and void, and praying that an account be taken of the dealings between the parties. The value of the property of the defendant taken by the plaintiff, and which it offers to return or account for, was not, comparatively speaking, of great value, and was so connected with the plaintiff's property as to make it impossible to interfere with the one without affecting the other. There is another difficulty in this case: Under the contract all the operators on this line are the employes of the railroad company, and the offices or stations belong to that company. Now, a dissolution of this injunction, and granting another in favor of the defendant, might nominally restore the dedefendant's connection over this line of telegraph; but what practical benefit would that be to the defendant unless the employes of the railroad company could be compelled to work the line, or the defendant company be permitted to place operators in the stations of the railroad company to operate the wires?\n\nThis question involves largely the right of the defendant to have a decree for the specific performance of the contract.\n\nIs this a case in which a specific performance could be had if the contract was legal? To say the least, it would be very doubtful. Marble Co. v. Ripley, 10 Wall. 339, 358-9 ; Railroad Co. v. Railroad Co. 13 Ohio St. 544 .\n\nIn brief, this contract being absolutely void, and the plaintiff having taken peaceable possession of the property, accompanied with legal proceedings to have the contract declared null, and for an account to be taken between the parties, in my judgment the defendant cannot compel a restitution of the property under the contract pending the proceedings.\n\nA temporary injunction may be continued until the session of court.\n\n[*422] And on May 8th the following order was entered in said case:\n\nIn the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Kansas.\n\nTHE CENTRAL BRANCH UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD COMPANY (otherwise known as the Atchison & Pike's Peak Railroad Company) v. THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY.\n\nAT CHAMBERS, TOPEKA, KANSAS, May 8, 1880.\n\nNow comes the Central Branch Union Pacific Railroad Company, by J. P. Usher, and Everest & Waggener, its solicitors, and the Western Union Telegraph Company, by W. C. Webb, George R. Peck, and Tomlinson & Griffin, its solicitors, and thereupon came on to be heard the motion of the the defendant, the Western Union Telegraph Company, to vacate, set aside, and dissolve the temporary restraining order, granted herein on the twenty-seventh day of February, 1880, upon consideration whereof it is ordered by the court that said motion be and the same is hereby denied and overruled. And it is further ordered that the said temporary restraining order granted herein on the twenty-seventh day of February, 1880, be and the same is hereby continued in full force and effect until the regular term of this court, commencing at Leavenworth, in said district, on Monday, the seventh day of June, 1880, and until the further order of the court.\n\nThe motion of the defendant, Western Union Telegraph Company, for temporary injunction, came on to be heard, and was argued by counsel, on consideration whereof it is ordered that said motion be and the same is hereby denied and overruled.\n\nC.

Loup.", "court": "Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Missouri", "date": "April 3, 1880.", "text": "[*697] TREAT, J. The question presented involves the construction of the United States statutes pertaining to internal revenue, and particularly section 3376. The defendant is charged in the indictment with having had in his possession internal revenue stamps that had been theretofore used and cancelled. It appears from the arguments and statements of counsel, rather than otherwise, that the facts are that defendant did have in his possession parts or halves of several stamps which had theretofore been used, which could readily be placed on a package in such a position as to give them the appearance of a complete stamp; but no complete, unbroken or unmutilated stamp.\n\nUnder the stipulation of counsel this court is asked to determine whether, on such a statement of facts, the defendant can be found guilty of the offence charged under section 3376.\n\nReference has been made to many other sections or the statute, supposed to be in pari materia; and, on the other hand, the rules of construction as to criminal statutes have been invoked. Where a statute containing many provisions as to distinct subjects, each of which has its own peculiar requirements, is presented for interpretation, the requirements and penalties of one cannot, in a criminal proceeding, be imported into another. Stamps, according to the law and regulations, are to be placed on packages of snuff in a prescribed manner, whereby the opening of the package will destroy the stamp. As to brewer stamps, the statute is very specific as to the mode of placing them on the packages and destroying them; and, as to stamps to be used for some other purposes, it is provided that they shall be \"utterly\" destroyed, etc.; yet as to snuff stamps no such requirement exists, because it is presumed that if attached as demanded they will necessarily be ruptured or torn into parts. The fact that more specific provisions are contained in the statutes as to other articles would indicate, not that such provisions should obtain as to snuff, but that snuff stamps were intended to follow a different rule\u2014a rule specific as to them.\n\nThe statute has several provisions which will adequately [*698] protect the government against fraud by manufacturers or dealers in snuff without importing into section 3376 words not there. It would have been very easy for congress to have enacted that the possession of any part of a stamp previously used should be punishable, if such had been the purpose; or it might have been enacted that the possession of parts which were capable of being united or reunited, etc., should be an offence. When the specific mode of using stamps for tobacco and snuff, as prescribed by the statutes and regulations thereunder, is considered, it is evident that section 3376 contemplated stamps detached as a whole, and not the mere possession of fragments of stamps, no matter how capable of being used.\n\nIf stamps previously used are again affixed to a package, or if not destroyed when the package is emptied, etc., the section provides for appropriate penalties. Why, then, should a court go beyond the terms of the section to declare that to be an offence, by construction, which the statute does not make an offence, especially when the same section makes punishable any failure to destroy the stamp on opening the package, or any affixing of the stamp to a new package?\n\nThe question must be resolved in favor of the defendant, although the facts stated indicate a fraudulent purpose on his part.\n\n\n\nMCCRARY, J., concurs."}

Bayne, Jr., for defendant in error.\n\n\n\nBefore PARDEE, Circuit Judge, and LOCKE and BRUCE, District Judges.\n\n\nBRUCE, J. This is a suit brought in the court below by the plaintiff, who is appellant here, against the defendant telegraph company, appellee, for damages for an alleged breach of contract and duty on the part of defendant in failing to deliver in due time a telegraphic message from plaintiff to his brokers, Latham, Alexander & Co., in New York city. The message was in these words:\n\n\"COLUMBUS,MISS.,Feb. 20th, 1890.\n\n\"To Messrs. Latham, Alexander & Co., New York, N. Y.:Sell 200 Tennessee Coal and Iron.[Signed]E. CAHN.\"\n\nPlaintiff avers in his complaint\n\n\"That said message was delivered to and received by the agent or operator of the defendant at its office in Columbus, Miss., on or about 7 o'clock P. M., on Thursday, the 20th day of February, 1890; * * * that, anticipating an early, rapid, and heavy decline in the value and price of the stock of the Tennessee Coal & Iron Company, and desiring to sell 200 shares of said stock before the decline began, with a view of purchasing later on the same number of shares when the price and value thereof had reached a much lower figure, thereby realizing the difference in the market value thereof at the time of sale and repurchase, and knowing that Latham, Alexander & Co. held said stock, and would sell the same on his account, repaying themselves out of the money of plaintiff in their hands, and would, at the option of the receiver or purchaser, deliver, before a quarter past two o'clock on same day, said stock certificate and power irrevocable in the name of witness, or guarantied by a member of the New York Stock Exchange, or a friend represented at the exchange, residing or doing business in New York, or by transfer of said stock as provided by the constitution and rules of the New York Stock Exchange, plaintiff delivered said message to the defendant, to be transmitted to New York, to be delivered to the said Latham, Alexander & Co.; that, if said message bad been transmitted and delivered in due time, the said brokers would have made the sale on the 21st day of February, at $73 per share.\"\n\nBut plaintiff avers\n\n\"That said message was not promptly transmitted and delivered as agreed, but by the gross negligence of defendant's servants and operatives in charge of the same it was delayed, and not delivered until the 28th day of February, 1890, when said stock had fallen in price to, and was selling in the market at, $55 per share, thus taking several times longer for its transmission and delivery than it required in due course of mail from Columbus, Miss., to New York city; and that the cause of the delay and non-delivery of said message, plaintiff avers, was negligence of the defendant's operators and servants. * * * Wherefore plaintiff sues and demands judgment for $3,451.66, and costs.\"\n\n[*812] To this declaration there are several pleas: (1) The general issue, not guilty. (2) That the message mentioned in the declaration was a night message; and that plaintiff failed to present claim for damages to defendant company within 30 days, as required by the regulations of the company. (3) Defendant sets up contract with plaintiff that no claim for damages should be valid unless made within 30 days after the message was sent, and that the plaintiff failed to present his said claim. (4) Defendant sets up contract that sender of message should not claim damages beyond a sum equal to ten times the amount paid for the transmission of the message, and pays into court the sum of five dollars,amount of its alleged liability. (5) That said defendant denies that said plaintiff had in the possession of said Latham, Alexander & Co., or in the possession of any one else, subject to their control, 200 shares of the stock of the Tennessee Coal & Iron Company, at the time of the sending of said message; and avers the fact to be that it was the intention of the plaintiff that said brokers, Messrs. Latham, Alexander & Co., should pretend to sell the amount of stock so named in telegram to be delivered or subject to delivery on the 21st day of February, 1890; but the real intent of all the parties to said transaction was to speculate on the rise or fall of said stock, without any intention of selling or delivering the same, but, when called for, to settle the difference between the contract price and the market price on the day when called for,that is to say, a settlement on margins. Wherefore said defendant says that said transaction was illegal and void, and this it is ready to verify. Replications are filed to second and third pleas; issue joined in fifth plea; issue, in short, by consent to replication to the third plea. The case came on for trial before a jury on the issues presented on the pleadings, and, after hearing the testimony, plaintiff filed his motion for a peremptory instruction to the jury charging them that they shall find a verdict for the plaintiff for the sum to which he is entitled on the facts in testimony, which motion, after argument by counsel pro and con, was by the court overruled and refused, to which plaintiff then and there excepted; whereupon the defendant filed its motion for a peremptory instruction to the jury charging them that they shall find a verdict only for the amount of the telegram on the facts in testimony, and, after argument, the court gave the instruction found in the record. The charge is, in effect, \"that the plaintiff cannot recover; the claim for damages is too remote, uncertain, and speculative, and will not be allowed by you in your verdict.\" To the giving of the charge the plaintiff excepted. The verdict of the jury was for 32 cents and three-fourths of a mill, to which the plaintiff excepted, and tenders his bill of exceptions, embodying all the testimony and the rulings and order of the court.\n\nThe assignment of errors, as far as necessary to be here stated, are: The court erred in giving the instruction to the jury as to the measure of damages in the cause. The circuit court erred in refusing to give the special instruction asked by plaintiff. The question, then, is, did the court err in instructing the jury on the trial of the cause that the claim made by the plaintiff for damages is too remote and speculative to be [*813] allowed by the jury in its verdict? A number of cases are cited by the counsel for appellee to sustain the ruling of the court, among which is the case of Telegraph Co. v. Hall, 124 U. S. 444 , 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 577 . In that case the message was to buy, and not to sell, as in the case at bar. It was dated December 9, 1882, and should have reached the sendee at Oil City, Pa., at 11:30 A. M. that day, but the message was not delivered until the exchange had closed for the day, so that Hall could not purchase the petroleum ordered by the plaintiff; and that at the opening of the board the next day the price had advanced from $1.70 per barrel, the price on the previous day, to $2.25 per barrel, at which price Hall did not deem it advisable to make the purchase, and did not do so. The message was, \"Buy ten thousand, if you think it safe.\" The court held there could be no recovery, because, in point of fact, the plaintiff had suffered no actual loss, and the court say at page 454, 124 U. S. , and page 580, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. :\n\n\"It is clear that, in point of fact, the plaintiff had not suffered any actual loss. No transaction was in fact made, and, there being neither a purchase nor a sale, there was no actual difference between the sums paid and the sums received in consequence of it, which could be set down in a profit and loss account. All that can be said to have been lost was the opportunity of buying on November 9th and of making a profit by selling on the 10th; the sale on that day being purely contingent, without anything in the case to show that it was even probable or intended, much less that it would have certainly taken place.\"\n\nThe case at bar is the counterpart of the case cited. The order was to sell 200 shares of stock, but by the fault of the telegraph company this order was not delivered to appellant's brokers in New York, as it should have been, on the morning of the 21st, and not until the 28th; and there was no sale of the stock on the 21st, or on any subsequent day. And it may be said here, as it was there, \"all that can be said to have been lost was the opportunity to sell\" at a higher price on the 21st and buy at a lower price afterwards. The claim in the case at bar goes much beyond any rule of damages in any of the cases cited. It is not for the difference in the price of the stock between what it was on the 21st, when the order to sell should have been received by the brokers in New York, and what plaintiff actually sold for on a repeated order and no sale on any subsequent day, not even on the 28th, when the order was received, but not acted upon, by plaintiff's brokers. In the case cited, which seems to be quite elaborate, the court, at page 455, 124 U. S. , and page 580, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. , goes on to say:\n\n\"It is well settled, since the decision of Masterson v. Mayor, etc., 7 Hill, 61 , that a plaintiff may rightfully recover the loss of profits as a part of the damages for breach of a special contract, but in such a case the profits to be recovered must be such as would have accrued and grown out of the contract itself as the direct and immediate result of its fulfillment. In the language of the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts, in Fox v. Harding, 7 Cush. 516 : 'These are part and parcel of the contract itself, and must have been in the contemplation of the parties when the agreement was entered into; but, if they are such as would have been realized by the party from other independent and collateral undertakings, although entered into in consequence [*814] and on the faith of the principal contract, then they are too uncertain and remote to be taken into consideration as a part of the damages occasioned by the breach of the contract in the suit.'\"\n\nCounsel make a somewhat vigorous attack on the soundness of the decision in the case of Telegraph Co. v. Hall, and say it will never be applied beyond the facts in that particular case. However that may be, we find it cited by the supreme court of the United States approvingly in the case of Howard v. Manufacturing Co., 139 U. S. 205 , 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 500 , where it was held\n\n\"That in an action to recover the contract price for putting up mill machinery anticipated profits of the defendant, resulting from grinding wheat into flour and selling same had the mill been completed at the date specified in the contract, cannot be recovered by way of damages for delay in putting it up.\"\n\nAnd in that case Justice LAMAR, speaking for the court, at page 206, 139 U. S. , and page 503, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. , says:\n\n\"The grounds upon which the general rule of excluding profits in estimating damages rests are (1) that in the greater number of cases of such expected profits are too dependent upon numerous uncertain and changing contingencies to constitute a definite and trustworthy measure of actual damages; (2) because such line of profits is ordinarily remote, and not, as a matter of course, a direct and immediate result of the non-fulfillment of the contract; (3) and because most frequently the engagement to pay such line of profits, in case of default in the performance, is not a part of the contract itself, nor can it be implied from its nature and terms.\" CitingTelegraph Co.v.Hall, and other authorities.\n\nWe think the case at bar falls within the principle of the case of Telegraph Co. v. Hall, and much authority is cited in line with that decision, so that we do not see why that should not be taken as settled law; at least the case is binding upon us.\n\nAgain, the plaintiff ordered the sale of 200 shares of Tennessee Coal & Iron stock,not his stock, which he held or owned, for he does not claim to have held or owned any such stock at the time of this transaction; but it is said his brokers, Latham, Alexander & Co., had the stock,not even that they had it and owned it, but, as the witnesses Latham and Alexander both say, in answer to interrogatory 15, (and it may be noticed in passing that the answers of these two witnesses to this interrogatory, and to most of the other interrogatories, are in the same identical words, and notable for the statement of conclusions rather than facts:)\n\n\"If Latham, Alexander & Co. had received the said telegram of E. Cahn when it should have been delivered, they would have executed the order within contained, and sold for him 200 shares of stock of the Tennessee Coal & Iron Co., and would have supplied stock in their possession for delivery on account of the sale, according to the custom of the New York Stock Exchange, if said Cahn did net own the stock.\"\n\nThere is at least some obscurity in the meaning of this answer, and the constitution and rules of the New York Stock Exchange are not in the record, and we have not the opportunity of referring to them. The fact is, however, conceded that Cahn did not hold or own the stock in [*815] question at the time of the order to sell on February 21st, nor did he have money in the hands of his brokers at the time to purchase the stock. Latham and Alexander again both testified, in answer to the same question, in the same words:\n\n\"Latham, Alexander & Co., on the 21st of February, 1890, did not hold for E. Cahn any stock of the Tennessee Coal & Iron Co. Latham, Alexander & Co. did not hold for E. Cahn any money on deposit with which to buy or sell stock, but they did hold for him securities sufficient to warrant them in making the sale of said stock as directed had the message been received on the morning of February 21, 1890.\"\n\nAppellant could doubtless have gone into the market and bought the stock for present or future delivery, could have authorized his brokers to do it for him, or they could supply it themselves, as they testify they would have done had they received the order; and, if so, and Cahn had paid or become liable for the market price of the stock that day, there would have been no profit to him in the transaction, and therefore no damage. If, by supplying the stock, Latham and Alexander mean that their firm would have loaned it to him, then his case is that, by the alleged negligence of the defendant company, he was prevented from borrowing 200 shares of Tennessee Coal & Iron stock, and selling it on the 21st of February at its market price on that day, and buying the same number of like shares of stock on the 28th, or on a subsequent day, when the market price had fallen; and so suffered a loss of the profits he would have made if he had borrowed, sold, bought back, and returned, the stock to his brokers. Manifestly, in such a transactionor, rather, want of transactionthe alleged damages are too uncertain, remote, and contingent to constitute a proper basis for a recovery.\n\nIt is insisted that an order, and delivery to an agent of a telegraphic company for transmission, to sell shares of stock, under the circumstances of the transaction in question, implies and means an order to buy to \"cover,\" as it is called; and that such will be held to have been within the knowledge and contemplation of the parties, the plaintiff (appellant) and the appellee, (telegraph company.) Telegraphic companies transmit and deliver messages, for hire, touching business or other relations of the persons who employ them. It is not like contracts between persons for the building of structures, erecting machinery, or even for the delivery of goods, in all of which classes of cases much depends upon what may be considered to have been fairly and justly within the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made; and it may be questioned whether an order to sell 200 shares of a given stock delivered to a telegraph operator for transmission over his line would imply knowledge on his part that an order to purchase the same number of shares of same stock would surely follow. It is said that Scott, the telegraph operator at Columbus, Miss., was informed and well knew the purpose and object of the message, but he says in his deposition:\n\n\"I understood it was an order to Mess. Latham, Alexander & Co. to sell 200 shares of Tennessee Coal & Iron,just what appears on the face of the message.\"\n\n[*816] But, even if he (Scott) was familiar with transactions of this character made in the stock exchange in New York, his company could hardly be held responsible on account of such knowledge possessed by one of its employes. But, even if it could be conceded that an order to sell implied an order to buy, the question remains uncertain as to when such an order to buy would be given for execution. That would, in the nature of things, depend upon the market, and upon the buyer's judgment of the market. Again, the legal, if not the only, presumption would be that Cahn was ordering the sale of his own stock, and not that he contemplated the sale of something he neither had nor proposed to acquire, with no intention that in the sale ordered an actual delivery of the stock was to be made, for such presumption would involve a violation of the law as it has been held in some of the highest courts in the country. In any view of the case, we perceive no error in the charge to the jury in the court below, and the judgment is affirmed; and it is so ordered."}

It was claimed by the United States that the defendant has earned profits which were so used during that period amounting to $326,000, on which no tax was paid.\n\nThe defences were: First, that returns were made each year, and accepted by the government, upon which taxes were assessed and paid; that no assessment has been made for the additional amounts now claimed, and if there were errors and omissions in the returns they cannot now be corrected, nor can the taxes now be recovered without an assessment; second, that the defendant in fact paid taxes on all profits made [*701] during the period in question, and that the profits shown by their books during that period, on which tax is claimed, are fully wiped out by certain items charged to profit and loss in 1869.\n\nThe court disposed of the first defence as follows: An action of debt may be maintained to recover taxes, without an assessment, where the statute describes the subject of the taxes and fixes the rates so that the amount may be ascertained by evidence. Dollar Savings Bank v. U. S. 19 Wall. 227 ; King v. U. S. 99 U. S. 229 ; The U. S. v. S. J. Tilden, 24 Int. Rev. Rec. 99 .

Co. v. Slack, Collector, 26 Int. Rev. Rec. 60 .\n\nThis being an action against the corporation for taxes imposed by statute, and not upon an assessment for taxes, the limitation of 15 months within which an assessment may be made does not apply; and congress not having fixed a time within which an action of this character shall be brought, \"no laches can be imputed to the government, and against it no time can run so as to bar its rights.\" The U. S. v. Thompson, 98 U. S. 486 ; The U. S. v. Kirkpatrick, 9 Wheat.; The U. S. v. Williams, 5 McLean, 133 .\n\nIt is not necessary now to consider the effect of the lease by the defendant to the Pennsylvania Central & St. Louis Railway and the Pennsylvania Railroad Company further than to say that such lease did not dissolve the corporation, and it may still be sued for liabilities incurred prior to such lease. But whether the property can be subjected to the [*702] satisfaction of a judgment obtained, and the mode of subjection, are questions not now before the court.\n\nUpon the second defence the court held that a portion of the items charged to profit and loss in 1869 was properly chargeable to expenses and losses incurred in operating the road during the period named, and should be deducted from the amount of apparent profits shown by their current reports, thus reducing the sum to $168,707.22, upon which the plaintiff was entitled to recover the tax of 5 per cent., amounting to $8,435.36. The remaining items charged to profit and loss in 1869, being the estimated depreciation of assets during the period in question, the court held not to be properly chargeable to expenses, and could not be deducted from profits earned during the period, and used in construction or carried to the credit of any fund.\n\nExceptions were taken by the defendant, and the case will be carried to the supreme court."}

{"id": "XOKFORQNB5G0.txt", "judge": "CURIAM", "plantiff": "Ruppel & McKinley", "defendant": "Patterson and others.", "case_title": "Ruppel & McKinley v. Patterson and others.", "court": "Circuit Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania", "date": "March 5, 1880.", "text": "Date: March 5, 1880.\nJudge: CURIAM\n\nKenneth McIntosh, for plaintiffs.\n\n\nS. W. Cunningham and B. D. Kurtz, for defendants.\n\n\nPER CURIAM. The relation of principal and surety imports an obligation on the part of the principal to indemnify the [*221] surety as against every liability growing out of that relation, and so to reimburse him whatever sum he may pay necessarily by reason of his vicarious engagement. Especially is this obligation imperative where payment has been made involuntarily by the surety under the coercion of a legal proceeding, which he exhaustively, though unsuccessfully, contested. It is no answer to his demand for reimbursement to say that questions which he fairly presented in the creditor's suit, and were decided against him by a court of competent jurisdiction, were decided erroneously, and ought to be reconsidered and rejudged, because the only duty which the law imposes upon him, as between him and the principal debtor, is to oppose to the creditor's action every proper defence known to him, or to cast the burden of defence entirely upon the principal by giving him notice to that effect. In either case the result is decisive as to the principal and surety alike, in a subsequent controversy between them.\n\nThis is the purport of the instruction to the jury, and we are unconvinced that there was any error in it.\n\nAs it is practically decisive of the defendants' liability it is immaterial to consider whether the alleged release by Stewart to the defendants discharged the debt claimed here, and so released the plaintiff, as surety, or was only a covenant not to sue the defendants, with a revocation of the creditor's right of action against the plaintiff. It is not an open question.\n\nThe remaining reason for a new trial is the alleged error of the court in instructing the jury that the statute of limitations began to run against the plaintiff from the time when he paid the debt for which he was liable as surety, and not from the time when the defendants made default in the payment of it to their creditor.\n\nIt is obvious that, until the plaintiff paid the debt, he had no legal demand against the defendants, nor could he maintain an action at law to recover it. Now the statute of limitations operates imperatively upon legal remedies only, precluding a resort to them after six years from the date when the right to maintain them accrued. Until the plaintiff was in a position to maintain an action against the defendants the [*222] statute did not begin to run against him. This is too clear to need amplification.\n\nIt is argued, however, that upon the defendants' omission to pay the debt at its maturity the plaintiff might then have required them to exonerate him from his liability, and that hence from that time the statute of limitations began to run. Ardesco Oil Co. v. North American Oil & Mining Co. 16 P. F. Smith, 66 Pa. St. 375 , is referred to to sustain this argument. It is there held to be \"well settled that as soon as the surety's obligation becomes absolute he is entitled in equity to require the principal debtor to exonerate him,\" 381, and that this right is enforceable by an action, in which the measure of damages is the amount of the debt for which the surety is liable. It is distinctly recognized as strictly an equity, which may be thus enforced only because, under the peculiar system which exists in Pennsylvania, equity is administered through common law forms. But this exceptional mode of administration does not change the character of the right. It is still an equitable incident to the relation of principal and surety, which entitles the latter to demand protection against the former's possible default, and is, in its nature, distinct from and independent of the surety's legal remedy where the burden of payment has been actually cast upon him. Out of the payment of the debt the surety's right to employ such remedy springs, and hence it is clear that the statute of limitations has no relation to it until it accrues.\n\nThe motion for a new trial is, therefore, denied, and judgment is directed to be entered on the verdict."}
